    Background There is a lack of knowledge about oral care among older people living in short‐term care (STC) units and how the quality of oral care provided by nursing staff is perceived by the older people. Aim To (i) describe person‐related conditions among older people in STC, (ii) describe and compare perceptions of the quality of oral care (including perceptions of care received and the subjective importance of such care), within and between older people who have the ability to perform oral self‐care and those who are dependent on help with oral care and (iii) examine the relationship between person‐related conditions and the quality of oral care. Methods A cross‐sectional study was conducted with 391 older people in STC units in Sweden based on self‐reported questionnaire and clinical assessments. Results The older people were assessed as having normal oral health (2%), moderate oral health problems (78%) or severe oral health problems (20%). When comparing older people's perceptions of quality of oral care in terms of perceived reality and subjective importance, significant differences appeared within and between groups. Psychological well‐being had a significant relationship with perception of the quality of oral care (both perceived reality and subjective importance), and gender and oral health status had a significant relationship with subjective importance. Conclusions Older people's perceptions of areas for improvement regarding quality of oral care is a new and important knowledge for nursing staff in STC units. Older people want personalised information regarding oral health and oral care. Registered Nurses who take the responsibility in nursing care for older people's oral health may avoid unnecessary suffering by older people caused by oral health problems.
