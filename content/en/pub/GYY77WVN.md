    <h1>About</h1>
    Elmoselhi et al. conducted a study to understand how prolonged isolation and confinement during space missions affect the body's small blood vessels and arteries. They examined four crew members who participated in an 8-month space analog mission. Using retinal imaging, they observed changes in the small blood vessels in the eye, noting trends that suggest potential damage and increased risk for heart and brain health issues. They also measured arterial stiffness, which showed an upward trend, indicating that the arteries might become less flexible over time. Although these findings were not statistically significant, they highlight the need for further research to ensure the health and safety of astronauts on long-term missions to the Moon and Mars.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Isolation and confinement are significant stressors during space travel that can impact crewmembers’ physical and mental health. Space travel has been shown to accelerate vascular aging and increase the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders. However, the effect of prolonged isolation and confinement on microvascular function has not yet been thoroughly investigated.MethodsRetinal vascular imaging was conducted on four crewmembers during- and post-8-month SIRIUS-21 space analog mission. Central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE), central retinal venular equivalent (CRVE), and arteriovenous ratio (AVR) were measured. Pulse wave velocity (PWV), an indicator of arterial stiffness, was also measured.ResultsData from 4 participants was analyzed. These participants had a mean age of 34.75 ± 5.44 years, height of 170.00 ± 2.00 cm, weight of 74.50 ± 12.53 kg, and average BMI of 25.47 ± 3.94 kg/m2. During- and post-isolation, average CRVE showed an upward trend (Pearson’s r 0.784, R-square 0.62), suggesting a dilation of retinal venules, while AVR showed a downward trend (Pearson’s r −0.238, R-square 0.057), which is suggestive of a higher risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular dysfunctions. But neither of these trends were statistically significant. Additionally, the average PWV showed an upward trend during- and after-isolation across all crew members.ConclusionIsolation and confinement appear to contribute towards retinal vascular damage and arterial stiffness. This cautiously suggests an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders due to the contribution of the isolation in space flight. Further studies are needed to confirm and expand on these results as we prepare for future manned missions to the Moon and Mars.
