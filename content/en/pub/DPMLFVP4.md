    <h1>About</h1>
    Víquez-R et al. studied the gut health of red deer in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. They compared deer living freely, those in winter enclosures, and those in permanent enclosures. By analyzing fecal samples, they found that deer in enclosures had more diverse gut bacteria but fewer important gut symbionts, which are beneficial bacteria. Free-ranging deer had less diversity but healthier gut microbiomes with fewer harmful bacteria. Deer in winter enclosures showed characteristics between the other two groups. These findings suggest that supplemental feeding and enclosure conditions significantly affect deer gut health. Understanding these impacts can help improve management practices for better animal health.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in the health and well-being of animals. It is especially critical for ruminants that depend on this bacterial community for digesting their food. In this study, we investigated the effects of management conditions and supplemental feeding on the gut bacterial microbiota of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. Fecal samples were collected from free-ranging deer, deer within winter enclosures, and deer in permanent enclosures. The samples were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene. The results showed that the gut bacterial microbiota differed in diversity, abundance, and heterogeneity within and between the various management groups. Free-ranging deer exhibited lower alpha diversity compared with deer in enclosures, probably because of the food supplementation available to the animals within the enclosures. Free-living individuals also showed the highest beta diversity, indicating greater variability in foraging grounds and plant species selection. Moreover, free-ranging deer had the lowest abundance of potentially pathogenic bacterial taxa, suggesting a healthier gut microbiome. Winter-gated deer, which spent some time in enclosures, exhibited intermediate characteristics between free-ranging and all-year-gated deer. These findings suggest that the winter enclosure management strategy, including supplementary feeding with processed plants and crops, has a significant impact on the gut microbiome composition of red deer. Overall, this study provides important insights into the effects of management conditions, particularly winter enclosure practices, on the gut microbiome of red deer. Understanding these effects is crucial for assessing the potential health implications of management strategies and highlights the value of microbiota investigations as health marker.
