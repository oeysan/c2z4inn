    <h1>About</h1>
    König et al. conducted a study to find the best way to use satellite data to detect bark beetle infestations in forests. Bark beetles are a major problem for forests, especially with climate change making infestations more common. The authors tested different combinations of satellite data from Landsat, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1 to see which was most effective. They found that Sentinel-2 data alone provided the most accurate results, detecting infestations with 93% accuracy. Landsat data was slightly less accurate, and combining different satellite data did not improve results. Sentinel-1 data was the least effective. This research is important because it helps improve methods for monitoring and controlling bark beetle outbreaks, which can save forests and maintain healthy ecosystems.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Bark beetle infestations are among the most substantial forest disturbance agents worldwide. Moreover, as a consequence of global climate change, they have increased in frequency and in the size and number of affected areas. Controlling bark beetle outbreaks requires consistent operational monitoring, as is possible using satellite data. However, while many satellite-based approaches have been developed, the full potential of dense, multi-sensor time series has yet to be fully explored. Here, for the first time, we used all available multispectral data from Landsat and Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 SAR data, and combinations thereof to detect bark beetle infestations in the Bavarian Forest National Park. Based on a multi-year reference dataset of annual infested areas, we assessed the separability between healthy and infested forests for various vegetation indices calculated from the satellite data. We used two approaches to compute infestation probability time series from the different datasets: Bayesian conditional probabilities, based on the best-separating index from each satellite type, and random forest regression, based on all indices from each satellite type. Five different sensor configurations were tested for their detection capabilities: Landsat alone, Sentinel-1 alone, Sentinel-2 alone, Landsat and Sentinel-2 combined, and data from all satellite types combined. The best overall results in terms of spatial accuracy were achieved with Sentinel-2 (max. overall accuracy: 0.93). The detections of Sentinel-2 also were the closest to the onset of infestation estimated for each year. Sentinel-2 detected infested areas in larger contiguous patches with higher reliability compared to smaller patches. The results achieved with Landsat were somewhat inferior to those of Sentinel-2 (max. accuracy: 0.89). While yielding similar results, the combination of Landsat and Sentinel-2 did not provide any advantages over using Landsat or Sentinel-2 alone (max. accuracy: 0.87), while Sentinel-1 was unable to detect infested areas (max. accuracy: 0.62). The combined data of all three satellite types did not achieve satisfactory results either (max. accuracy: 0.67). Spatial accuracies were typically higher for Bayesian conditional probabilities than for random forest-derived probabilities, but the latter resulted in earlier detections. The approach presented herein provides a flexible disturbance detection pipeline well-suited for the monitoring of bark beetle outbreaks. Furthermore, it can also be applied to other disturbance types.
