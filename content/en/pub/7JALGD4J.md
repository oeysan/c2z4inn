    <h1>About</h1>
    Sponberg and Mathiesen examined how Norwegian newspapers have portrayed large predators, like wolves and bears, from the 1970s to today. They found that wolves are mentioned most often, but positive coverage of wolves has decreased over time, while positive coverage of bears has increased. Local newspapers tend to have more negative portrayals than national ones. The study suggests that negative experiences with predators in local areas lead to more negative articles, which could influence readers' attitudes towards these animals. Understanding how media coverage affects public perception is important for managing human-wildlife conflicts and promoting conservation efforts. This research highlights the significant role media plays in shaping attitudes towards large predators.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In the late century of 1800 till mid-1900s,  
large predators were eradicated worldwide, and bounties were commonly used to get rid of the predators.  
In the twentieth century the policy changed, and  
predators became protected by law. The “return” of  
the predators has resulted in negative human–wildlife  
interactions and an increase in social conficts. Media  
plays a key role in most social conficts, as positive  
portrayals can lead to an increased willingness to  
conserve the species, as opposed to negative portrayals. We have looked at how Norwegian newspapers  
portray the large predators from when they were protected by law in the 1970’s till today. Our results show  
that wolves represent the most articles, and the positive mentioning of wolves has decreased, while for  
bears this has increased. Local newspapers contained  
more negative portrayals than national newspapers,  
and changes in wolf establishment, predator management or politics impact on the number of articles. As  
our fndings indicate that negative experiences with  
predators, in particular in local areas, associate with  
negative articles in the local newspapers, we believe 
this could contribute to negative attitudes towards  
predators among those who are readers of the local  
newspapers. This is yet to be studied in more detail  
and would be recommended to better understand the  
role of media in human–wildlife conficts.
