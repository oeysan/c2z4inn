    <h1>About</h1>
    Calignano and De Siena conducted a study to see if innovation helps regions in Italy resist economic downturns, specifically during the 2008-2014 recession. They looked at various factors, including job changes in high-tech sectors, to measure innovation. Surprisingly, they found that innovation did not significantly help regions withstand economic challenges. Instead, other factors like the diversity of economic activities, changes in GDP, population density, and geographical location were more important for economic resistance. Interestingly, having a variety of related industries was actually linked to lower economic resilience. This study suggests that for Italian provinces, focusing on a mix of different economic activities might be more effective than relying solely on innovation to weather economic storms.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Innovation is considered a key variable for determining regional economic resistance. However, a very few studies aiming to determine the existence of a relationship between innovation and regional resilience - in its various dimensions - have been carried out until now. Our paper aims at narrowing the gap in this regard by looking at the ability of ‘resistance' showed by the Italian provinces (NUTS3 level) in the 2008-2014 recessionary period. Our statistical analysis reveals that innovation, proxied by employment variation rate in high tech sectors, is not clearly associated with ‘resistance' at the regional level. Other variables such as diversity of regional economic activities, GDP variation rate, population density and geographical location are actually associated with a higher degree of resistance, while related variety shows an inverse and statistically significant correlation.
