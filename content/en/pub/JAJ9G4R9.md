    <h1>About</h1>
    Jussila et al. conducted a study to understand how workers in Arctic open-pit mines protect themselves from the cold and whether their clothing is effective. They surveyed 1,323 miners in Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Russia about their experiences with cold and the clothing they use. They also measured the thermal insulation (how well clothing keeps heat in) of the miners' clothing using a thermal manikin, a device that simulates human body heat. The study found that while miners choose their clothing based on factors like time spent outdoors and personal cold sensitivity, the clothing often isn't warm enough for temperatures below -10°C. This finding is important because it highlights the need for better protective clothing to ensure miners' safety and comfort in extremely cold conditions.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Workers in the Arctic open-pit mines are exposed to harsh weather conditions. Employers are required to provide protective clothing for workers. This can be the outer layer, but sometimes also inner or middle layers are provided. This study aimed to determine how Arctic open-pit miners protect themselves against cold and the sufficiency, and the selection criteria of the garments. Workers' cold experiences and the clothing in four Arctic open-pit mines in Finland, Sweden, Norway and Russia were evaluated by a questionnaire (n=1,323). Basic thermal insulation (Icl) of the reported clothing was estimated (ISO 9920). The Icl of clothing from the mines were also measured by thermal manikin (standing/walking) in 0.3 and 4.0 m/s wind. The questionnaire showed that the Icl of the selected clothing was on average 1.2 and 1.5 clo in mild (-5 to +5°C) and dry cold (-20 to -10°C) conditions, respectively. The Icl of the clothing measured by thermal manikin was 1.9–2.3 clo. The results show that the Arctic open-pit miners' selected their clothing based on occupational (time outdoors), environmental (temperature, wind, moisture) and individual factors (cold sensitivity, general health). However, the selected clothing was not sufficient to prevent cooling completely at ambient temperatures below -10°C.
