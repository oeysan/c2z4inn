    <h1>About</h1>
    Müller and Søberg conducted a study at Oslo Metropolitan University to explore the use of a digital diet planning task (DPT) in teacher education. Students tracked their food and drink intake over 24 hours, calculated nutrients and energy using a digital program, and compared their diets to official health recommendations. They then reflected on how to improve their diets. Data from questionnaires, interviews, and observations showed that the task increased students' awareness of healthy eating and was seen as relevant to their future teaching careers. While students appreciated the method for learning content, it did not significantly enhance their digital skills. Overall, the DPT helped students develop knowledge useful for their professional roles as teachers.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This practitioners' inquiry focuses on students' and teacher educator's experiences and reflections in implementing a digital diet planning task (DPT) as a learning/teaching method in an academic primary and secondary school teacher education at Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet). DPT involved students individually registering of all foods and beverages they ate during a 24- hour period, computing nutrients and energy consumptions by using a digital program and evaluated their diets by comparing these with the Norwegian Health Directorate's nutrients and diet recommendations. They also reflected on what food they could remove or substitute in order to consume a healthier diet. 
 
The data was collected by a questionnaire administered to 23 students, interviews of eight students, and teacher educator's observation notes. The findings indicate that the task made the students more aware of healthy food choices based on scientific knowledge and regarded DPT as relevant to their future teacher careers. Most students responded positively to DPT as a teaching/learning method and meant that DPT supported their learning of the subjects' content knowledge but only little new digital skills. The results indicate that several students had propositional content knowledge, teachers' knowledge and professional knowledge.
