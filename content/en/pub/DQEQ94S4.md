    <h1>About</h1>
    Foster et al. conducted a study to understand why some Latino families succeed in preventing childhood obesity despite challenging circumstances. They compared families whose children moved from an obese weight to a healthy weight with those whose children remained obese. The study found that families who succeeded often had lower education levels but higher confidence in their ability to manage their children's health. These families also tended to have a strong Mexican cultural orientation and effectively involved other caregivers in creating healthy food environments. Surprisingly, differences in diet and physical activity were less significant than expected. This research highlights the importance of caregiver involvement and self-efficacy in promoting healthy weight outcomes in children.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Childhood obesity is a complex public health challenge that requires innovative, sustainable solutions. Positive deviance, inspired by the science of complexity, is an approach that examines what allows certain individuals to succeed despite being predicted to fail. This study is aimed at identifying and defining positive deviants for early childhood obesity. Methods. This case-control study used medical record data to identify Latino children aged 2–5 and classify them using their longitudinal weight change. Parents of children with trajectories toward a healthy weight from an obese weight (cases) and parents of children with stable obese weight trajectories over time (controls) were recruited. Mixed-methods analyses were used including a semi- structured interview and quantitative surveys evaluating diet, physical activity, sleep, feeding practices, and self-efficacy. Qualitative description was applied to the qualitative data; quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and lo- gistic regression modeling. Results. Of eligible Latino children identified from the overall data set (n � 1, 621), 257 (16%) had trajectories toward a healthy weight, and among these, 21 positively deviant cases completed the study with 23 matched controls. Positive deviant families were characterized by lower education, higher self-efficacy, and a more Mexican cultural orientation. Findings suggest that effective engagement of other caregivers and creating healthy food environments were important de- terminants of healthy weight outcomes. Conclusions. Positive deviants (cases) were distinct from controls in several parenting strategies such as creating healthy food environments and engaging caregivers. They had higher self-efficacy despite lower education. There were fewer differences in diet and physical activity than expected.
