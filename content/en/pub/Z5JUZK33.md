    <h1>About</h1>
    Skalny et al. reviewed studies from the past 20 years to understand the link between mercury exposure and cancer. They found mixed results: some studies showed a strong connection between mercury levels in the body and cancer risk, while others did not. In lab experiments, high doses of mercury were toxic to cells, and low doses seemed to make both normal and cancer cells grow more. Mercury might interfere with important cell processes and cause DNA damage, which can lead to cancer. It also seems to affect how genes are regulated, although the exact details are unclear. Overall, mercury could still be a cancer risk, and more research is needed to understand how it works.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The present study aims to review epidemiological and experimental toxicology studies published over the last two decades linking mercury (Hg) exposure and carcinogenesis, with a special emphasis on the potential underlying mechanisms. While some epidemiological studies have observed a strong association between environmental/occupational Hg exposure levels, measured in blood, toenail, and hair, and cancer risk and mortality, others failed to reveal any association. In experimental models, high-dose Hg exposure has been linked with cytotoxicity, whereas low-dose exposure was posited to induce proliferative responses in both normal and cancerous cells by interference with estrogen receptor, ERK1/2, JNK, NADPH-oxidase and, potentially, Nrf2 signaling. Combined with reduced apoptosis and pro-survival signaling upon low-dose Hg exposure, accumulation of DNA lesions in cells may predispose to an increased risk of malignant transformation. In addition, the pro-oxidant activity of Hg species may induce oxidative DNA modifications and inhibits DNA repair mechanisms. Furthermore, epigenetic effects of Hg exposure seem to contribute to the carcinogenic activity, although the particular mechanisms have yet to be characterized. Therefore, even after 20 years of research, one cannot consider Hg as a non-carcinogenic agent, whereas specific mechanisms of Hg-induced toxicity may promote carcinogenic risk.
