    <h1>About</h1>
    Løhre et al. conducted a study to understand how people perceive climate predictions that use wide intervals. Wide intervals in forecasts are more likely to be accurate because they cover a broader range of possibilities. However, these wide intervals can seem less certain to the public because they provide less specific information. Through six experiments, the authors found that people generally view wide intervals as a sign of uncertainty rather than certainty. This perception is influenced by how questions are framed. The study suggests that using wide intervals in climate reports might not effectively communicate high certainty to the public, challenging current practices in climate science communication. This finding is important for improving how climate information is shared and understood.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The use of interval forecasts allows climate scientists to issue predictions with high levels of certainty even for areas fraught with uncertainty, since wide intervals are objectively more likely to capture the truth than narrow intervals. However, wide intervals are also less informative about what the outcome will be than narrow intervals, implying a lack of knowledge or subjective uncertainty in the forecaster. In six experiments, we investigate how laypeople perceive the (un)certainty associated with wide and narrow interval forecasts, and find that the preference for accuracy (seeing wide intervals as “objectively” certain) versus informativeness (seeing wide intervals as indicating “subjective” uncertainty) is influenced by contextual cues (e.g., question formulation). Most important, we find that people more commonly and intuitively associate wide intervals with uncertainty than with certainty. Our research thus challenges the wisdom of using wide intervals to construct statements of high certainty in climate change reports.
