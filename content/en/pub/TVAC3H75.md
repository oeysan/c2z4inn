    <h1>About</h1>
    Mutonyi conducted a study on university employees in Norway to understand how psychological factors influence their innovative behavior. They found that psychological capital (PsyCap), which includes confidence, hope, resilience, and optimism, and psychological empowerment (PsyEmp), which is the feeling of being empowered at work, both positively impact employees' ability to innovate. Additionally, the study revealed that organizational cultures focused on teamwork (clan culture) and competition (market culture) also boost PsyCap. Importantly, PsyCap acts as a bridge, enhancing the effect of PsyEmp on innovative behavior. This research suggests that university managers should focus on fostering PsyCap and supportive organizational cultures to encourage innovation among staff.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Purpose – The purpose of this study is to examine the role of psychological capital (PsyCap) among employees 
in the higher education (HE) sector. Specifically, the aim of this paper is threefold. First, this study explores the 
effect of psychological empowerment (PsyEmp) and the two organizational culture factors of clan and market on 
PsyCap. Second, the study also examines the relationships between PsyEmp, PsyCap and individual innovative 
behavior (IIB). Third, this paper examines the mediating role of PsyCap on IIB and PsyEmp. 
Design/methodology/approach – A conceptual model was developed and tested on 250 university 
employees in Norway. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. 
Findings – The analysis shows that both PsyCap and PsyEmp have a direct positive relationship with IIB. 
The results also reveal that PsyEmp, clan culture and market culture are all positively and significantly 
linked to PsyCap. The relationship between IIB and PsyEmp is also mediated by PsyCap. 
Originality/value – This study extends the knowledge of PsyCap in the context of the HE sector. For 
managers, the study highlights the importance of investing in and managing employees’ PsyCap. In addition, 
although perceived PsyEmp at work can strengthen the level of IIB among employees, employees’ PsyCap can be 
much more influential. Furthermore, the study contributes new knowledge regarding the symbiotic nature of 
various organizational culture types and the benefits of having both a clan culture and a market culture in 
enhancing organizational capabilities.
