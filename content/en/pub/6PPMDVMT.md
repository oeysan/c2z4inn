    <h1>About</h1>
    Hov et al. conducted a study in Norway to understand how patients in the late stages of palliative care and their relatives perceive security in homecare settings. They surveyed 32 patient-relative pairs using a questionnaire that measured both the actual care received and its importance. Patients generally felt secure about the medical and physical aspects of their care but had concerns about continuity. Relatives, however, rated the overall security lower, especially in terms of coordination and cooperation. Both groups found the importance of care higher than the actual care received. These findings highlight the need for improving continuity and coordination in palliative homecare to ensure both patients and their relatives feel secure and supported.

    Abstract 
Background: As palliative care increasingly takes place in patients’ homes, perceptions of security among patients 
in the late palliative phase and their relatives are important. 
Aim: To describe and compare patient-relative dyads regarding their perceptions of security in palliative homecare, 
including the perceived security of the actual care given to the patients, as well as the subjective importance of that care. 
Methods: A cross sectional questionnaire study including 32 patient-relative dyads was conducted in an urban 
municipality in Norway. Patients were in a late palliative phase and received palliative homecare. Each patient proposed 
one relative. Data were collected using a modified version of the Quality from the Patients’ Perspective instrument (QPP), 
which focuses on security and comprises three dimensions: medical-technical competence, identity-orientation approach 
and physical-technical conditions. Context-specific scales containing four aspects (competence, continuity, coordination/ 
cooperation, availability) were added. The instrument contains two response scales; perceived reality (PR) and subjective 
importance (SI). Data were analysed by descriptive statistics, Chi-squared test, T-test and Wilcoxon’s signed rank test. 
Results: Patients had high mean scores on the PR-scale for the sense of security in palliative homecare in the dimensions 
of medical-technical competence and physical-technical conditions. There were three low mean scores on the PR-scale: 
the aspect of continuity from patients and the aspects of continuity and coordination/cooperation from relatives. 
The patients scored the SI scale statistically significantly higher than the PR scale in the identity-orientation approach 
dimension and in the aspect of continuity, while relatives did so in all dimensions and aspects. 
The intra-dyadic patient-relative comparisons show statistically significant lower scores from relatives on the PR-scale in 
the dimensions of medical-technical competence, physical-technical conditions, identity-orientation approach and the 
aspect coordination/cooperation. 
Conclusions: There are several statistically significant differences between patients and relatives’ perceptions of security in 
the palliative homecare received (PR) compared with the subjective importance of the care (SI) and statistically significant 
differences in the patient-relative dyads in PR. A relatively mutual sense of security in palliative homecare is important for 
patient-relative dyads, as relatives often provide care and act as patients’ spokespersons. What they assess as important 
can guide the development of palliative homecare.
