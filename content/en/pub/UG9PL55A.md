    <h1>About</h1>
    Næss and Hanssen studied why many Secretary Generals (SGs) of Norwegian sport federations left their jobs between 2015 and 2019. They found that 52% of SGs resigned, which is much higher than the average turnover rate in Norway. This is a problem because SGs play a crucial role in managing sports federations that impact 1.9 million members and oversee significant financial resources. Through interviews with 16 SGs, the authors identified six main reasons for the challenging working conditions, including heavy workloads and complex human relationship responsibilities. Their findings highlight the need for organizational changes to improve job stability and effectiveness in sport leadership. This research is important because it addresses the stability and efficiency of leadership in sports, which affects many people and resources.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Between 2015 and 2019, 52 per cent of the Secretary Generals (SGs) of Norwegian sport federations left their positions. As this rate is significantly 
higher than in the Norwegian labour market in general and poses a further 
difficulty for a Norwegian sport system already facing many challenges, 
this article examines why this is the case. The topic is relevant because the 
working conditions of Norwegian sport leaders are under-explored given 
their important role in the way sporting federations shape society. As key 
representatives for the national federations under The Norwegian Olympic 
and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports (NIF) umbrella, 
SGs and Presidents have responsibility for NIF’s 1.9 million members and 
are instrumental in managing a total worth of approximately 34 billion euros. Because SGs can be said to be more integrated than Presidents into the 
daily management of federations and into the human relationship responsibilities that comprise it, this article draws upon qualitative interviews 
with 16 Secretary Generals to present six reasons why working conditions 
challenges emerge. The article thus provides a contribution to sport leadership research and shows how the lack of continuity among SGs in national sport federations demonstrates the need for organisational change.
