    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background/Objectives: There is a rising global demand to educate independent and reflective nurses capable of addressing the evolving needs of healthcare systems and diverse populations. The Indonesian Nursing Act solidifies the professional status of nurses, although challenges persist including discrepancies between practice and educational standards. There is a need to increase the competence of Indonesian nurse educators and their ability to facilitate learning that can strengthen the nursing programs’ quality and improve the nurses’ ability to address various health issues in the population. The aim of the study was to describe the nurse educators’ experiences with developing student-active methods in nursing education in Indonesia. Methods: This study is part of an Erasmus+ project: Capacity Building in Nursing Education in Indonesia (CABNEI). A three-year educational program for nursing educators in Indonesia was developed. The current study used a qualitative, descriptive design with a questionnaire containing four open-ended questions focusing on the educators’ experiences with developing student-active methods and conditions affecting this process. Data were collected between January and November 2022 and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: A total of 32 educators from two universities and two nursing schools in Indonesia participated. The analysis revealed the theme “A change of pedagogical approaches to nursing students’ learning” with three categories: “Setting the stage for pedagogical development in the nursing education”, “From correction to reflection”, and “Factors affecting the educators’ learning process”. Conclusions: The nursing educators’ experiences with developing student-active methods in Indonesia were positive. They reported incorporating additional pedagogical tools into their teaching methods and nursing programs. Management is vital in facilitating active-learning strategies. It is important to foster collaborative opportunities for educators and enhance their pedagogical skills to meet the healthcare system’s evolving needs and society’s demands for sustainable nursing expertise.
