    <h1>About</h1>
    Grønseth and Skinner explore how movement and travel impact wellbeing in today's world, focusing on diverse experiences of health and misfortune. Their book examines various aspects of mobility, such as patients traveling for medical care and asylum seekers seeking better living conditions. They also look at public health services for marginalized groups and cultural events promoting wellbeing. By using real-life examples from different countries, the authors show how people, migrants, and governments make decisions about health and wellbeing. This study highlights the complex ways in which social relationships and personal experiences shape our understanding of wellbeing, emphasizing that experiences of health and suffering are varied and influenced by mobility. Understanding these dynamics can help improve policies and support systems for those on the move.

This volume examines the relationship between movement and wellbeing from patient mobility to asylum seeker wellbeing, from public health care provision for marginalized peoples to arts care festivals for all. It demonstrates how knowledge is created between and within social relations, imaginations and persons, and uses detailed ethnographic examples from around the world to explore how citizens, migrants and nation states calculate and act upon issues of health and wellbeing. The goal is to show just how diverse and mobile experiences of misfortune, suffering and wellbeing can be"
