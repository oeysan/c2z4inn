    <h1>About</h1>
    Kolberg et al. conducted a study in southeastern Norway from 2014 to 2017 to understand how the timing and intensity of spring fieldwork affect soil and cereal yields. They found that early fieldwork in wet conditions led to larger, stronger soil clumps, higher resistance to penetration, altered pore characteristics, and reduced yields. These effects persisted until autumn. The study also showed that the number of times machinery passed over the soil (traffic intensity) had a smaller impact, influenced by location and soil type. The findings are important because they help farmers adapt their practices to changing weather patterns, ensuring better soil health and crop yields despite increased rainfall. This research highlights the need for careful planning of fieldwork to avoid soil damage and maximize cereal production.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Future increase in precipitation in Scandinavia may exacerbate the dilemma of spring fieldwork that farmers have, concerning topsoil compaction versus delayed sowing on autumn ploughed soil. The former may lead to soil physical degradation, while the latter may lead to a shorter growing season, both with consequential loss of cereal yield potential. In order to enable farmers to adapt their spring fieldwork to climate change, research needs to include seedbed preparation at higher soil moisture conditions. A split-plot experiment in southeastern Norway in 2014–2017 explored the effects of timing (early, medium, late) and traffic intensity (zero, one, two or three additional wheelings) of spring fieldwork on soil physics and yield. Early spring fieldwork in the unfavourably wet conditions of 2016 gave rise to larger and stronger aggregates, higher penetration resistance, changed pore characteristics and reduced yields. Increased penetration resistance persisted until autumn. The small effect of traffic intensity was explained by location, soil type and intensity range involved. In this context of spring fieldwork timeliness, the proportion of 2–6 mm aggregates and penetration resistance were the properties most strongly correlated with other soil physical properties and cereal yield.
