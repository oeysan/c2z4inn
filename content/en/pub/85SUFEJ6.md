    <h1>About</h1>
    Quennerstedt et al. conducted a study on the use of fitness tests in physical education (PE) in Sweden. They explored whether these tests, often seen as demotivating and embarrassing for children, could be used in a more inclusive and creative way. By applying a "norm-creative" approach, which challenges traditional ideas about body weight and form, they found that fitness tests can sometimes reinforce negative body hierarchies, making larger bodies feel invisible. However, when used paradoxically, these tests can also encourage creativity in movement and reflection on societal norms about justice and body image. This study suggests that fitness tests, if taught thoughtfully, can become a valuable educational tool in PE.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In many countries, fitness testing is used in physical education (PE). Advocates of fitness testing maintain that testing promotes physical activity and has long-term health benefits. Other scholars question using fitness tests for children in educational contexts and describe them as demotivating, embarrassing, and humiliating. The purpose of the study is to contribute to this educational dilemma with knowledge on the use of “fitness tests” in PE practice. This is done by exploring a pedagogical intervention in Sweden where tests were used to teach from a norm-creative perspective and considering how bodies with different weight and form could be included. We draw on “new materialist” methodologies, asking what tests do and can do in PE practice. In our analysis, we brought together six affective elements of what tests do. Many tests produced traditional PE practices, and there were apparent silences regarding body hierarchies, which often render big bodies invisible. Teaching tests paradoxically, however, also produced opportunities for creativity in moving and opportunities to reflect upon norms about justice and “normal” bodies. This analysis highlights the potential of teaching with the test in order for fitness tests to become educational.
