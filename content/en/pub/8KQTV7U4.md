    <h1>About</h1>
    Ferguson-Cradler examined how four major German electricity utilities responded to a sudden change in nuclear power regulations in 2011, which coincided with increased competition from renewable energy and economic challenges. This study highlights the concept of "transition risk," where economies and financial systems face dangers from abrupt shifts away from fossil fuels. The utilities adopted different strategies to cope with the crisis, showing varied approaches to adapting their operations and financial plans. Understanding these responses can help businesses prepare for rapid changes in energy production and manage risks associated with such transitions. This research is important for planning future energy strategies and ensuring stability in the face of sudden regulatory and market changes.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In 2011, the major German electricity-producing utilities faced an existential crisis: a sudden and unexpected volte-face on nuclear power regulation together with greatly increased competition from renewables and severe economic downturn in their core markets. The situation approximates, on a small scale, fears around what has been called “transition risk”: the danger to economies and financial systems posed by an abrupt transition away from fossil fuel energy production. This article takes a business history approach to consider what one case of a “sudden stop” looked like on the ground. How did the four major German electrical utilities react to a situation in which their operations, strategies, and balance sheets were suddenly thrown into disrepair? In the end, the utilities adopted widely varying strategies in attempts to adapt to changing circumstances. The reasons for and ways in which companies chose differing paths in response to similar external shocks can be instructive for thinking about cases where deep and rapid transformation is necessary and how scenarios with potential for transition risk might unfold at the firm level.
