    <h1>About</h1>
    Ellefsen and Karlsen examine how the concept of "diversity" is used in music education, focusing on Norway's Schools of Music and Performing Arts. They analyze a new curriculum framework to understand how diversity is defined and applied. The study identifies four key aspects: diversity in students' cultural backgrounds, educational opportunities, deeper understanding, and learning environments. The authors argue that while the framework aims to promote diversity, it must be effectively integrated into daily teaching practices to truly benefit students. This matters because it highlights the importance of not just having policies that support diversity, but ensuring these policies are actively implemented to enhance student participation and empowerment in music education.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In this article, we enquire into the language of diversity as it is currently in use in the field of music education, by way of exploring the social and educational ambitions of the Norwegian system of extra-curricular, Schools of Music and Performing Arts. We take as our case the recently launched governing document of this particular educational system, named Curriculum framework for schools of music and performing arts: Diversity and deeper understanding. Analysing this document as a discursive statement, and through a Foucauldian theoretical lens, we investigate the meanings of “diversity” enacted within and across the various textual-discursive contexts of the curriculum framework, identifying and exploring four nodal points of signification, namely: 1) diversity understood as difference in students’ ethno-cultural backgrounds; 2) diversity of educational opportunities and modes of expression; 3) diversity and/or/as deeper understanding; and 4) diversity of learning arenas and contexts: entrepreneurial expectations. The discussion of the findings is conducted in dialogue with a historical understanding of the Norwegian Schools of Music and Performing Arts’ societal mandate and approach to diversity as well as various understandings of diversity within the international field of music education research. We conclude by pointing out that the macro-level institutional strategy and aim of emphasising and encouraging diversity cannot be understood as fulfilled before it has been sufficiently operationalised and has trickled down into the everyday actions of teachers and students. Only then is it implemented as a tool accessible on the micro-level and with the potential to enhance students’ participation and agency.
