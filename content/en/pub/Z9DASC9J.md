    <h1>About</h1>
    Colbjørnsen et al. examined how streaming services like Netflix manage the availability of cultural content, despite their promise of "unlimited entertainment." They found that these services do not offer every possible item, which creates challenges for policymakers aiming to ensure access to cultural materials. Using a case-based approach, they studied nine Norwegian award-winning or critically acclaimed books, movies, and TV series. Their research introduced the term "contingent availability" to describe how various conditions affect what content is accessible on streaming platforms. They discovered that while cultural policies help secure availability for most cases, they struggle to address the fragmentation of content availability. This study highlights the need for better strategies to ensure comprehensive access to cultural content in the digital age.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Streaming services have emerged as increasingly important access points for cultural content, often promising, as Netflix does, ‘unlimited entertainment’. However, the actual conditions of availability remain under-examined. While streaming services typically contain a vast selection of objects, they certainly do not hold the total amount of all possible items. Streaming services thus pose new challenges for policymakers who wish to ensure access to, and availability of culture. In this paper, we build on previous research to develop the term ‘contingent availability’ and discuss how cultural items are made available in streaming contexts. Departing from a pyramid model of availability, we investigate these levels empirically through a case-based approach. Nine Norwegian award-winning or critically acclaimed books, movies and TV series were strategically selected to highlight how availability in streaming services is contingent upon multiple conditions. For each case, we assess the ways in which Norwegian cultural policy influences production, distribution and availability of culture. We discuss how cultural policy measures do secure availability for most of the cases, but is unable to effectively combat fragmentation of availability.
