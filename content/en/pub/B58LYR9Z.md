    <h1>About</h1>
    Nielsen conducted a study to understand how an interactive exhibition called "A World at Stake" affects students' curiosity about global poverty and inequality. The exhibition is inspired by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and was held at Glomdalsmuseet in Norway. The study surveyed 1,094 students aged 9-17 years. The findings show that students who are interested in social and natural environments, and who feel a sense of responsibility and participation, are more likely to become curious about these global issues. Additionally, students who felt a sense of mastery, or confidence in their abilities, during the exhibition were more likely to have their curiosity stimulated. This suggests that engaging and empowering educational experiences can effectively raise awareness and interest in important global challenges.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This article focuses on students’ experiences with A World at Stake, an interactive exhibition inspired by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. The research aim of the study was to explore factors contributing to students’ curiosity-evoking capacities for global poverty and inequality, with a particular emphasis on experiences of mastery. The research was based on a survey conducted at Glomdalsmuseet in Norway among students aged 9–17 years (n =1094). The data analysis was performed using quantitative methodology analysis in IBM SPSS version 20. Results indicate that students’ interests in social and natural environments, and their sense of responsibility and participation, seem to stimulate curiosity. In particular, students’ experiences of mastery in the exhibition are positively associated with their curiosity-evoking capacities.
