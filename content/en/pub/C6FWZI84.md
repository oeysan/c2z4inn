    <h1>About</h1>
    Løvsletten et al. conducted a study to understand how outpatient commitment (OC) works from the perspective of municipal health-care workers in Norway. OC is a legal decision requiring patients to receive mental health care while living at home. The study surveyed 230 health-care workers experienced with psychosis and OC decisions. They found that the tasks performed by health-care workers for patients with OC were similar to those for patients without OC, except for discussions about medication. Despite patients' legal rights, individual plans to aid follow-up were rarely used. Additionally, health-care workers lacked knowledge and education about the OC system, and cooperation between municipal and specialist health services was poorly defined. This matters because it highlights areas needing improvement to better support patients under OC.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background:Outpatient commitment (OC) is a legal decision for compulsory mental health care when the pa-tient stays in his or her own home. Municipal health-care workers have a key role for patients with OC decision,but little is known about how the legislation system with OC works from the municipality's point of view.Method:The present study has a quantitative descriptive design using an electronic questionnaire sent to health-care workers in the municipalities that participated. The study included health-care workers from the mentalhealth services in two counties in Norway who have experience with psychosis and OC decisions.Results:There were 230 people who received the questionnaire. The sample consisted of various health pro-fessionals from both small and large municipalities.The results show which tasks they have in follow-up ofpatients in the municipalities.Conclusion:From the municipality's point of view, there are no significant differences in follow-up for patientswith or without an OC decision, apart from conversations about medication. An individual plan is rarely used tofacilitate follow-up, although this is the statutory right of patients with OC decisions. The health-care workerslack knowledge and education about the OC scheme. The cooperation between municipalities and the specialisthealth-care services is not clearly defined
