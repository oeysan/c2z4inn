    <h1>About</h1>
    Hydeskov et al. conducted a global review of studies on lead exposure in wild mammals, highlighting a gap in understanding its health effects. They examined 183 studies from 35 countries over 62 years, noting that only a small fraction were from developing countries. Most research focused on easily accessible species like hunted animals and small mammals, while carnivores and scavengers were less studied. Although all studies measured lead levels, only 25% explored health impacts, with negative effects ranging from mild to fatal. The varied methods used made it hard to compare results. The authors emphasize the need for more research, particularly on carnivores and scavengers, which could help monitor ecosystem health. This study underscores the importance of understanding lead's impact on wildlife.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    : Lead (Pb) is a toxic nonessential metal, known mainly for causing poisoning of humans and wild birds. However, little is known about Pb exposure and its associated health effects in wild mammals. We conducted a global systematic literature review to identify peer-reviewed studies published on Pb exposure in wild mammalian species and the health effects they identified. In total, 183 studies, conducted in 35 countries and published over 62 yr (1961–2022), were included in the review. Only 6% (11/183) of the studies were conducted in developing countries. Although 153 mammalian species were studied, most studies focused on species that are easy to access (i.e., hunted species and small mammals that are easy to trap). Therefore, carnivores and scavengers were less frequently studied than herbivores and omnivores. Despite all studies reporting Pb concentrations, only 45 (25%) studies investigated health effects and, of these 45 studies, only 28 (62%) found any health effect in 57 species. All health effects were negative and ranged from subclinical effects to fatality. Methodologies of Pb sampling and quantification and reporting of results varied widely across the studies, making both Pb concentrations and health effects difficult to compare and evaluate. Thus, there is a need for more research on Pb exposure and its health effects on wild mammals, especially as carnivores and scavengers could be used as sentinels for ecosystem health.
