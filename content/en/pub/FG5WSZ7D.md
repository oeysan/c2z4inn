    <h1>About</h1>
    Happell et al. conducted a study to understand how nursing students perceive the impact of Experts by Experience on their learning. Experts by Experience are individuals who have lived through mental health challenges and share their insights with students. The study involved focus groups with nursing students from five European countries and Australia. The findings showed that students felt these experts helped bridge the gap between theory and practice by providing real-life experiences that made theoretical concepts more relatable and engaging. Students also noted that this approach sparked their curiosity and offered innovative teaching methods. This integration is crucial for improving the quality of mental health nursing, as it helps students better understand and apply their knowledge in practical settings.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Purpose 
To examine nursing students' perceptions of Experts by Experience impact on theoretical and practical learning. 
 
Design and Methods 
Qualitative exploratory study involving focus groups with undergraduate nursing students from five European countries and Australia. Data were analyzed thematically. 
 
Findings 
Participants described positive impacts as: bridging the theory and practice gap through first‐hand experience, including sub‐themes: bringing theory to life; can't be taught any other way, and innovative teaching methods fueling curiosity. 
 
Relevance to Clinical Practice 
Integrating theory and practice is key for quality mental health nursing practice. Experts by experience can potentially contribute to reducing this enduring gap.
