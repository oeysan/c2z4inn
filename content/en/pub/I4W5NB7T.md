    <h1>About</h1>
    Trollvik and Severinsson conducted a study to understand the everyday experiences of nine parents with children who have asthma. Through in-depth interviews, they identified four main themes: feelings of uncertainty, helplessness, and guilt; the need for support from healthcare professionals; adapting to daily life; and developing coping strategies. Parents also used strategies like trying out different methods and seeking information to manage their child's asthma. However, they often felt disrespected and that their competence was questioned by healthcare professionals. The study highlights the importance of open communication between parents and healthcare providers to help parents gain the skills needed to care for their children effectively. This research underscores the need for better support systems for parents dealing with chronic childhood illnesses.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The aim of the present qualitative study was to describe nine parents’ everyday experiences of liv- ing with a child suffering from asthma. Data were collected by means of in-depth interviews and phenomenological content analysis. Four main themes emerged: feelings of uncertainty, helpless- ness and guilt; the need for support and help from healthcare professionals; adaptation to everyday life; and the development of coping strategies. In addition, two subthemes; trying out and seeking information, emerged. Trying out was found to be an important strategy for parents in managing the illness. In encounters with healthcare professionals, parents felt that they were not respected and that their competence was questioned. In conclusion, this study emphasizes the importance of a mutual dialogue between healthcare professionals and parents to enable the parents to develop the competence necessary to care for their child.
