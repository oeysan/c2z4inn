    <h1>About</h1>
    Arntzen et al. explored ways to improve learning in universities by focusing on student-centered methods. They examined three cases from universities in Norway and Spain, highlighting the use of digital learning platforms like Canvas and Blackboard. While these tools help, they found that students often don't fully grasp the material. To address this, they suggest "learning by doing" approaches, such as project-based learning, where students work on real-life projects to develop skills and knowledge. This method involves students in creating their own exam scenarios, making learning more relevant and engaging. Their study provides a model for more effective learning in higher education, emphasizing practical experience and active student participation.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Knowledge is the most important asset in education. Knowledge Management has been the focus for many years in higher education. Recently,  universities have embraced innovative processes that could foster a better learning process. Digital learning platforms such as Canvas or Blackboard has   been deployed at the higher education to facilitate the learning process.  However,  it  is  still  recognized  that  knowledge  might  not  be  fully  acquired  by  students.  Adoption  of  technological artifacts has proven to be a good step forward; however, it seems not sufficient. Lately there has been a focus on how to implement student centric methodologies to foster learning effectiveness. For instance, Project-based learning (Trullàs, Blay, Sarri, & Pujol) approach intends to provide to students the possibility to be engaged in project reflecting similar issues suchin real life in order to further develop skills and competences. This paper outlines two approaches based on the leitmotiv “learning by doing” and on the implication of students in defining jointly a use case for their home exams. The paper presents 3 experiences from 3 universities based in Norway and Spain.  A model for an effective learning in Higher Education is delineated.
