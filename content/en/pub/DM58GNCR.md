    <h1>About</h1>
    Boson et al. conducted a study in Sweden to understand the differences between non-drinking and drinking adolescents over time. They followed 195 non-drinkers and 406 drinkers from ages 14 to 17, examining their mental health, social interactions, drug use, and attitudes towards alcohol. They found that non-drinkers generally had fewer social interactions, less positive attitudes towards alcohol, were less likely to use other drugs, and had fewer behavior problems. These traits suggest that non-drinkers might be more introverted. The study also found that these characteristics in 9th grade could predict continued abstinence from alcohol two years later. This research helps identify factors that contribute to alcohol abstinence among teenagers, which is important as alcohol consumption trends decline.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This study investigated whether non-drinking adolescents (n = 195), with no previous experience with alcohol, differed over time from drinking adolescents (n = 406). Potential differences in psychological health (mental well-being, psychosomatic symptoms, conduct problems), social interaction frequencies (new friends, time spent with friends and social interaction through a screen device), psychoactive substance use, and positive attitudes towards alcohol was investigated. Additionally, the study examined whether these attributes in 9th grade could predict total abstinence two years later. Non-drinkers were consistently characterized by fewer social interactions, less positive attitudes towards alcohol, a lower probability of using other drugs, and fewer conduct problems from 14 to 17 years, which may imply a more introverted personality function. This study contributes insights into predicting factors linked to alcohol abstinence in adolescence, particularly the characteristics of non-drinking adolescents in a society where a declining trend of alcohol consumption is emerging.
