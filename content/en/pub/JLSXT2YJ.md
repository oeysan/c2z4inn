    <h1>About</h1>
    Sagheim and Aas conducted a study on how participants perceive the images of two Scandinavian endurance skiing events, Birkebeinerrennet and Vasaloppet. They interviewed 52 participants to explore the different aspects that make up the image of these events. They identified ten key dimensions, such as organizational, environmental, emotional, and social factors, and introduced two new dimensions: equipment and destination. The study found that Birkebeinerrennet's image is closely tied to its location, while Vasaloppet has a stronger, more versatile image, making it less vulnerable to losing interest from specific participant groups. These insights can help event organizers attract more participants by enhancing the event's image. Future research could expand these findings to other endurance sports in various settings.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This study investigates event images of two Scandinavian 
endurance skiing events. It adds to the relatively limited literature on endurance sport event images and provides a better understanding of how participants perceive images of the cross country ski events Birkebeinerrennet and Vasaloppet, and to what extent the images are similar and different. A qualitative comparative case-study design was applied. The interview guide consisted of open-ended semi-structured questions, and 52 participants in Birkebeinerrennet and Vasaloppet were interviewed during March 2017. A ‘sport endurance event image’ can be composed of at least ten dimensions and Associated aspects: ‘Organizational’, ‘Environmental’, ‘Emotional’, ‘Social’, 
‘Historical’, ‘Physical’, ‘Competition’, ‘Cultural’, ‘Equipment’ and ‘Destination’. The findings confirm and expand earlier identified dimensions of sport event images by identifying two New dimensions (‘Equipment’ and ‘Destination’). The image of Birkebeinerrennet was more aligned with the destination than Vasaloppet, while the overall stronger and more versatile image of Vasaloppet makes it less vulnerable to loss of interest from narrow 
segments of participants. We offer insights about how participants perceive the race images, how two rather similar events also differ in their images, and how this can contribute to a better understanding of differences in popularity. The findings can help organisers work towards images that attract desirable visitors and participants. Future research should follow up these findings through quantitative investigations across different types of longdistance, endurance sport events taking place in different environments, seasons and regions.
