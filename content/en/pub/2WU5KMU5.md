    <h1>About</h1>
    Mikalsen et al. conducted a study on 46 obese patients in Norway to measure levels of toxic elements—lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and cadmium (Cd)—before and 12 months after bariatric surgery. They found that Pb levels in the blood increased by 73% after surgery, while Hg and Cd levels decreased by 31% and 27%, respectively. This is significant because many patients undergoing bariatric surgery are women of childbearing age, and increased Pb levels can negatively affect fetal development. The study also noted that patients with higher blood pressure had higher Hg levels before surgery. These findings highlight the need for further research to understand the implications of increased Pb levels following weight loss surgery.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Purpose 
Previous studies have suggested a role for the toxic elements lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) in the development of insulin resistance and hypertension. Increased blood Pb levels have been reported after bariatric surgery and weight loss. As about 80% of patients undergoing bariatric surgery are women, most of them of childbearing age, there are concerns regarding fetal exposure to toxic trace elements. We measured whole blood Hg, Pb and Cd concentrations in morbidly obese patients before and 12 months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). 
 
Patients and methods 
Forty-six patients eligible for bariatric surgery were recruited at Innlandet Hospital Trust, Norway (2012–2014). The majority were women and 54% were of reproductive age. Whole blood samples were collected prior to and 12 months after surgery. Trace element concentrations were measured using mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS). 
 
Results 
Median whole blood Pb concentrations increased by 73% during the 12 months study period while Hg and Cd decreased by 31% and 27%, respectively. We found a negative correlation between Pb levels before surgery and BMI (p = 0.02). Before surgery patients with hypertension had significantly higher median whole blood Hg levels compared to patients with normal blood pressure (p < 0.001). 
 
Conclusion 
One year after bariatric surgery, the median whole blood Pb concentration was increased, while Hg and Cd concentrations were decreased. The majority of bariatric surgery patients are women of reproductive age and weight loss is associated with improved fertility. As even low dose Pb exposure during fetal life is associated with negative effects on the central nervous system, the observed increase in whole blood Pb after weight loss causes concern. Further studies are needed to elucidate these observations.
