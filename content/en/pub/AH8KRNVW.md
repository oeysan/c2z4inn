    <h1>About</h1>
    Egan conducted a study comparing how the verb "tell" is used in English, Norwegian, and French. They found that English and Norwegian have some similarities when using "tell" with direct objects (like nouns), but fewer similarities with sentences that have clauses (parts of sentences that could stand alone). There was almost no similarity when "tell" was used with direct speech (quoting someone) and none with non-finite clauses (incomplete sentences). When looking at French translations, they discovered that French translations of Norwegian sentences were often more similar to the original Norwegian than to English translations. This study helps us understand how different languages handle similar verbs and sentence structures, which is important for translation and language learning.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This paper presents the results of a study of double object constructions containing the cognate verbs English telland Norwegian fortelle, based on data from the English–Norwegian Parallel Corpus. The results show that there is a certain degree of correspondence between the two verbs in constructions with nominal direct objects, with less mutual correspondence in constructions with finite clausal objects, very little correspondence in constructions with objects in the form of direct speech, and none whatsoever in the case of non-finite clausal objects, which only occur with tell. The paper then expands the topic to include TELLpredications in French. The data were retrieved from the Oslo Multilingual Corpus. It transpires that the form of French translations of Norwegian expressions are more similar, at least for some constructions, to the Norwegian originals than are their English counterparts.
