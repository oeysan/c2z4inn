    <h1>About</h1>
    Parmigiani et al. conducted a study to test the reliability and consistency of rubrics designed to assess global competence in pre-service teachers. Global competence involves understanding and interacting effectively with people from different cultures. The rubrics were used by 729 pre-service teachers from 12 education programs in 10 countries. The study found that the rubrics were highly reliable and consistent, meaning they effectively measure global competence. However, the analysis suggested that two areas of the rubrics needed adjustments. This research is important because it helps ensure that future teachers are well-prepared to teach in diverse, globalized classrooms.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Global competence is a complex concept as it is multifaceted, composite, multi-layered, multidimensional, and can be viewed from several perspectives. A previous study validated a set of rubrics designed to assess pre-service teachers’ development of global competence. The research presented in this paper tested the internal consistency and reliability of the set of rubrics in order to create an instrument validated within the international context that was robust and consistent from a methodological point of view. The set of rubrics was self-administered online by 729 pre-service teachers studying in 12 teacher education programmes across 10 different countries around the world. The data analysis showed a high level of reliability and internal consistency of the rubrics, indicating their ability to assess pre-service teachers’ global competence. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis suggested changes to two areas of the rubrics
