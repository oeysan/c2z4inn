    <h1>About</h1>
    Watten & Watten conducted a study to explore the relationship between using snus (a type of smokeless tobacco) and alcohol consumption. They compared 1,043 snus users to 1,043 non-users, matching them by age and gender. The study found that snus users generally had lower education levels, lower income, and poorer health, including mental and dental health, compared to non-users. Importantly, snus users drank more frequently, got intoxicated more often, and consumed more alcohol overall. Even after accounting for various background factors, snus users had significantly higher alcohol consumption both on weekdays and weekends. These findings suggest that using snus may be linked to increased alcohol use, which has important implications for addressing alcohol and nicotine dependence.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background: The use of moist smokeless tobacco (snus) is increasing in the U.S. and other Western countries, and especially among young people. Snus is associated with several health problems, but the relationship between use of snus and alcohol is scarcely explored. Neuro-cognitive and psychological research suggest an association due to possible mutually rewarding effects in the limbic brain. We investigated this issue in a matched controlled population study. Methods: Matched control group design where drinking habits and alcohol consumption in a group of users of snus (n = 1043, mean age = 35.20; n men = 749, n women = 294) were compared to a control group of non-users matched on age and gender (n = 1043, mean age = 35.65; n men = 749, n women = 294). In addition, we registered background variables such as level of education, income, self-perceived general, dental health, mental health, current depressive symptoms, and BMI. In estimation of alcohol consumption, the background variables were used as covariates in factorial analyses of variance (ANCOVA). Results: Users of snus had lower level of education, lower income, poorer general, dental, and mental health status than non-users, but there were no differences in BMI. Differences in mental health status were related to drinking habits. Users of snus had a higher frequency of drinking, higher frequency of intoxication, and showed more excess drinking. Controlled for background variables users of snus had a 25.2% higher estimated yearly consumption of alcohol in terms of standard units of alcohol on the weekdays, 26.4% higher on weekends and a 60.2% higher yearly excess consumption. Conclusion: Users of snus had an elevated alcohol consumption and another drinking style than non-users. The findings are discussed according to neuro-cognitive and psychopharmacological mechanisms, reward learning and conditioning. The results have implications for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of alcohol and nicotine dependence.
