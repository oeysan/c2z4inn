    <h1>About</h1>
    Rahman et al. studied the risk levels of different financial institutions in Australia, including banks and insurance companies. They found that major Australian banks pose a higher systemic risk, meaning they have a greater potential to impact the entire financial system, compared to other financial institutions. This risk increased after the global financial crisis (GFC), despite stricter rules being put in place. They also discovered that short-term risks are higher than medium- and long-term risks. The study used a method called ΔCoVaR to measure risk and found that specific characteristics of institutions and broader market conditions influence risk levels. Understanding these risks is important for maintaining financial stability and preventing future crises.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The Australian financial sector (AFS) is highly concentrated and interconnected. Besides, Australian banks' lending portfolios are dominated by residential mortgage loans, and 70% of insurance companies' revenues arise from non-policyholder sources. The AFS also performed relatively well during the global financial crisis (GFC). Given these distinctive features, in this paper, we examine the systemic risk contribution of Australian banks, insurance companies, and other financial services providers. We use a  flexible copula-based delta conditional value-at-risk (ΔCoVaR) method across different frequencies. Further, we study the systemic risk determinants in a panel setting. We find that the major Australian banks are systemically more important than all other financial institutions. Systemic risk is typically higher after the GFC than in the pre-crisis period, despite the introduction of more stringent capital requirements. In addition, the short-term ΔCoVaR is significantly higher than the medium- and long-term ΔCoVaRs. Finally, institution-specific characteristics and market-wide variables explain the cross-sectional and time-series variation in systemic risk, and their explanatory power varies across frequencies.
