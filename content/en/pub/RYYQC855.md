    <h1>About</h1>
    Dmitrow-Devold conducted a study to understand what digital skills teenage girls in Norway find important when blogging. Instead of just looking at the blogs they create, the study focused on the girls' own stories and experiences. The researchers discovered that the girls value different digital skills based on their blogging goals and the expectations of their blogging community. These skills and their meanings can be complex and sometimes contradictory. The study also found that the girls' blogging practices evolved over time, with some changes being positive and others potentially problematic or influenced by gender norms. This research highlights the diverse ways girls engage with digital technology and how their online activities are shaped by social expectations.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This article seeks to identify the digital competences experienced as meaningful by teenage girls, who blog within the mainstream blog community in Norway. Previous work has mostly had its basis in the artefacts produced by girls rather than in their stories of participation, and has discussed digital competences in abstract or normative terms. This study focuses on girls’ perspectives, identifies concrete digital competences they experienced as meaningful, and a range of complex, even contradictory meanings they attributed to the competences, depending on their blogging-related goals and the femininity norms of their community of practice. The study documents how the girls’ digital practices changed over time. While some of these modifications align with what is considered beneficial, others can be viewed as problematic or gendered.
