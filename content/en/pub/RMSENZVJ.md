    <h1>About</h1>
    Benediktsson et al. conducted a study on how Icelandic teachers support the language development of children from immigrant families in compulsory schools. They found that while teachers recognize the importance of students speaking multiple languages (plurilingualism), their teaching methods often focus more on learning Icelandic rather than embracing all the languages students speak. This is despite Iceland's national curriculum promoting inclusivity and equality. The study suggests that schools lack clear language policies and that teachers need more training to better support cultural and linguistic diversity. This matters because helping students maintain and develop their native languages alongside Icelandic can improve their overall educational experience and integration into society.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This paper explores seventeen Icelandic teachers’ perspectives and strategies for supporting the plurilingual development of children from first-generation immigrant families attending compulsory schools in Iceland. The data emerges from a large-scale qualitative research project entitled “Language policies and practices of diverse immigrant families in Iceland and their implications for education”. The study’s theoretical framework utilises multicultural education theory and the scholarship on culturally and linguistically sustaining pedagogies. The analytical process was conducted concurrently throughout the research period, employing qualitative procedures of thematic content analysis, coding, and cross-comparison of data. The findings indicate that despite the strong foundations of inclusivity, equality, and sustainability outlined in the Icelandic national curriculum guide and legal documents, there is a lack of clear language policies at the school level. Whilst the participating teachers acknowledge the importance of plurilingualism, their teaching methods and perspectives often remain at a surface level, prioritising the development of Icelandic over a deeper engagement with students’ full linguistic repertoires. Therefore, this study emphasises the need for a broader range of professional development opportunities to enhance teachers’ abilities to support cultural and linguistic diversity in compulsory schools in Iceland.
