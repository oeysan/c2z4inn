    <h1>About</h1>
    Saul's book explores how international human rights laws are applied within Indonesia's legal system. They examine the challenges faced by Indonesian courts in interpreting and enforcing these laws, highlighting a gap between international human rights standards and their local implementation. By analyzing specific cases in constitutional, criminal, and private law, Saul shows how Indonesian judges handle human rights issues. The book also discusses the influence of international law and the role of various actors, beyond the judiciary, in this process. This work is valuable for anyone interested in how national courts contribute to human rights enforcement, particularly in Indonesia, and offers insights for scholars, judges, and legal practitioners working in this field.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    "This book addresses the technicalities of how international human rights law can be applied at the domestic level through a case study of the human rights methodology of the Indonesian judiciary. Numerous international human rights treaties have been ratified by States parties all around the world. However, local implementation has proven a difficult task for national authorities with every State struggling to realise rights to varying degrees. This reveals a gap between the standards of human rights as envisaged by the law and those experienced by rights holders at the local level. This work analyses how Indonesian courts interpret and apply human rights. It discusses the position of human rights within specific areas of Indonesian law: constitutional law, criminal law and private law. It analyses how courts have dealt with specific cases within these fields of law. Its key contribution lies in its detailed attention to the role of the Indonesian judiciary in implementing human rights, as well as to the influence of international law, and the role that actors other than the judiciary play in this process. It also incorporates international comparative perspectives. The book will be of particular interest to human rights scholars concerned with national judiciaries' role in human rights implementation, and to scholars, judges, civil society actors and legal practitioners working with law and human rights in Indonesia"
