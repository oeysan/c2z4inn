    <h1>About</h1>
    Veggeland examines how the rise of the regulatory state in Europe has affected democratic governance in Scandinavia. By comparing different government structures in Scandinavia and the European Union, Veggeland explores the shift from traditional parliamentary government to a system where non-parliamentary bodies play a significant role. The book also discusses how economic and welfare state reforms have led to changes in organizational and institutional frameworks. These findings are important because they help us understand how governance is evolving and what that means for democracy and public policy. This book is useful for students, scholars, civil servants, and policymakers interested in political science and political economics.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This book studies the emergence of the regulatory state in Europe and its impact on democratic governance in Scandinavia. On the basis of comparative studies on various government structures in Scandinavia and the EU, the author analyses the repercussions of the change from government to dominant non-parliamentary democratic governance. In addition, readers will be introduced to the organizational and institutional changes and developments caused by economic and welfare state reforms. A cutting-edge resource, the book will appeal to students and scholars of political science and political economics, while also offering an engaging read for civil servants and policymakers.
