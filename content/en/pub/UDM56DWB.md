    <h1>About</h1>
    Kenttä et al. have written a position paper highlighting the mental health challenges faced by high-performance sports coaches. These coaches juggle complex responsibilities, including planning, leadership, and athlete development, all while ensuring the well-being and safety of their athletes. The demanding nature of the job often leads to high stress levels, making it an unsustainable profession for many. This paper emphasizes the need for focused attention on the mental health of these coaches. It discusses the challenges they face and suggests resources and strategies to prevent mental health issues and promote well-being. The authors provide recommendations for individuals, systems, and organizations involved with high-performance sports coaching to better support these professionals. This is important for maintaining a healthy and effective coaching environment.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    High-performance (HP) coaching has been described as “a complex, social, and dynamic activity that is not easily represented as a set of tangible and predictable processes.” Coaches are not only responsible for extensive planning, monitoring, and leadership in a dynamic and complex environment but also have responsibility for supporting athlete development and safeguarding their athletes’ overall health, well-being, and psychological and physiological safety. However, HP coaching is often considered an unsustainable profession, due to the levels of stress and subsequent mental health challenges that are frequently part of the role. Therefore, this position paper will focus on the concerns, challenges, and resources needed to prevent and manage mental ill-being and support the mental well-being of sport coaching professionals in HP sport, and provide recommendations for individuals, systems, and organizations that work with HP sport coaches.
