    <h1>About</h1>
    Stokke conducted a study in Norway to understand how people perceive and use the social alarm, a technology designed to assist home care services. Despite being a simple and established tool, the social alarm's integration into everyday life is complex and varies widely among users. The study used detailed observations and interviews to explore these varied expectations and experiences. It found that technology doesn't always work as a straightforward "plug-and-play" solution because people interpret and adapt it differently based on their needs and circumstances. This research highlights the importance of considering these diverse interactions when implementing technology in home care, as it can lead to unexpected challenges and benefits. Understanding these dynamics can improve how technology supports aging in place.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background 
Technological innovations are strongly promoted to meet the demands posed by increased pressure on home care services and to assist ageing in place in western societies. Although heavily advocated as plug and play solutions, technologies have proven difficult and unpredictable when integrated into home care services. We need greater insight into what happens when technologies are integrated into caring practices. All technologies come with expectations as to their function. This study explores how actors who are involved with the social alarm, which is an established technology innovation, relate to, perceive and articulate these expectations of the technology in everyday living. 
 
Methods 
The article presents results from a two-case study, using a triangulation of qualitative methods in order to gain an in-depth understanding of technology in use in home care services through “thick descriptions”. The study was conducted in Norway and data were analysed using a stepwise deductive-inductive analysis. 
 
Results 
The empirical findings demonstrate that expectations regarding the social alarm, even though it represents a simple and well-established technology, are complex and multidimensional. The notion of script and domestication provided relevant tools for exploring these expectations and for understanding how actors interpret and adapt their practices of using the technology. This enabled a more comprehensive understanding of how technology opens up for different interpretations and puts values in play. 
 
Conclusions 
This article suggests exploring technology in use as scripted in multidimensional script, and offers a frame for doing so. It also reveals how technology scripts and articulation prove important for understanding the complex reality when integrated into home care practices, thus identifying how using the technology leads to the taming and unleashing of both technology and actors. The study offers an increased understanding of how and why technology is unpredictable and works differently in different contexts. Moreover, it stresses the importance of avoiding expectations of plug-and-play in a reality of complex interactions between different actors
