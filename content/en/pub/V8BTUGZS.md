    <h1>About</h1>
    Birkvad explores the films of Joachim Trier, focusing on how young characters often see themselves as their own worst enemies. This inner struggle is a recurring theme in Trier's work, reflecting his tendency to examine all sides of an issue without passing judgment. The study highlights two films, "Reprise" and "Oslo, August 31st," which delve into these internal conflicts. Additionally, Birkvad discusses "Louder Than Bombs" and "Thelma," which address the challenges of gentle parenting and how it can complicate relationships. "Thelma" also introduces external forces that symbolize these inner battles. Understanding these themes can help viewers relate to the characters' experiences and recognize similar struggles in their own lives.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    A common problem for many young characters in the films of Joachim Trier – the feeling that their only antagonist in life is themselves – is also, in a sense, a problem Trier confronts as an artist, since he tends to consider all sides of a matter rather than passing judgement. The article identifies the complexity of Trier’s work through his thematization of the inner antagonist in Reprise and Oslo, 31. august (Oslo: August 31st) and the problematizing of ‘soft parenthood’ in Louder Than Bombs and Thelma. The latter film also represents a new genre-related externalization of inner, highly antagonistic forces.
