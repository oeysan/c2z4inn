    <h1>About</h1>
    Erdvik et al. conducted a study with 3,398 secondary school students to explore how feeling satisfied with basic needs in physical education (PE) relates to overall self-worth. They found that these two factors influence each other: satisfaction in PE can boost self-worth, and higher self-worth can enhance satisfaction in PE. This means that students who feel good about themselves are more likely to feel their needs are met in PE classes, while those with lower self-worth might not feel as supported. The study suggests that personalized support in PE could help students with low self-worth feel more satisfied and improve their overall self-esteem. This research highlights the importance of addressing individual needs in PE to foster better self-worth among adolescents.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This study investigated the temporal relations of adolescents’ basic need satisfaction in physical education (PE) and global self-worth in a sample of 3,398 lower and upper secondary school students (49% boys, 51% girls, average age T1 = 15.00, SD = 1.79). Four models and competing hypotheses were tested, and the model with bidirectional paths specified showed the best fit to the data. The bidirectional effect estimates suggest not only that basic need satisfaction in PE predicts global self-worth development but also that adolescents’ perceptions of global self-worth predict the degree to which they experience basic need satisfaction in PE. Findings could suggest that students with low global self-worth are less sensitive to basic need support in PE. These students may need personally tailored need-supportive initiatives in order to develop basic need satisfaction in PE and, thus, global self-worth through PE.
