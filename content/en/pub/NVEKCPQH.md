    <h1>About</h1>
    Ndlela and Tendai's book explores how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced media ethics worldwide. By examining various case studies from different regions, they highlight the complex ethical challenges faced by media during the pandemic. These include issues like misinformation, propaganda, and the portrayal of different groups, known as "Othering." The authors use diverse approaches to analyze these ethical dilemmas, offering insights that are relevant globally. Their work is important because it helps us understand how media ethics are affected during health crises, which can impact how information is shared and perceived. This book is useful for anyone interested in media studies, journalism, and public health, as it provides valuable perspectives on the ethical issues media face during pandemics.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This topical volume illuminates ethical issues brought to the fore by the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on a broad range of case studies from different regions, it provides insights into the multiple and complex ways in which the pandemic has shaped media ethics. 
 
The chapters employ a wide range of innovative theoretical and methodological approaches to dissect enduring and emerging ethical questions during the pandemic, providing lucid accounts of axiological dimensions in pandemic discourses, ethics of emotional mood, ethical challenges and dilemmas in news reporting, propaganda, misinformation, disinformation and Othering. While the case studies in this book are unique, the authors have extrapolated common strands from their analysis of ethical issues applicable to any other country or region during the pandemic, contributing unique perspectives on how media ethics are circumscribed by global health pandemics. 
 
The book will appeal to researchers, academics and practitioners at all levels in the fields of media studies, journalism, communication, media sociology and public health, as well as general readers and policymakers who are keen to learn more about how global health crises illuminate critical ethical issues confronting the media.
