    <h1>About</h1>
    Echebiri conducted a study to understand what personal factors contribute to employees coming up with new ideas at work. They surveyed 315 banking employees and analyzed the data using a statistical method. The study found that employees who have a strong need for independence are more likely to innovate, but this happens indirectly through self-leadership, which means taking initiative and managing oneself. Additionally, self-leadership directly boosts innovation. However, feeling that one's job allows for autonomy did not strengthen the link between self-leadership and innovation. These findings are important because they highlight specific personal traits that can encourage employees to be more innovative, which can help companies foster a more creative and productive work environment.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The purpose of this paper is to link individual-level factors (such as need for autonomy, selfleadership, and perceived job autonomy) to employee-driven innovation with self-leadership as an indirect link. The study is based on survey data of 315 employees in the banking sector, collected in two waves where the variables were separated in time. The hypothesized model was analysed using a structural equation model on Stata. First, it was found that the need for autonomy had an indirect association with employee-driven innovation through self-leadership. Second, the findings show that self-leadership had a positive relationship with employee-driven innovation. Finally, there was no support found for the moderating role of perceived job autonomy between self-leadership and employee-driven innovation. The findings in this paper are important because they identify individual-level antecedents of employee-driven innovation.
