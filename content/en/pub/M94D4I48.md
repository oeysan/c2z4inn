    <h1>About</h1>
    Kumbhakar and Lien studied the efficiency of Norwegian electricity distribution companies from 2000 to 2013. They looked at short-run inefficiency, which can change over time, and long-run inefficiency, which stays constant but varies between companies. They used three different models to measure efficiency and found that while technical changes and returns to scale were consistent, the efficiency scores varied significantly across models. This means that regulators and practitioners need to be careful when choosing which model to use, especially if they are using these efficiency measures to reward or penalize companies. This study helps ensure that companies are fairly evaluated and incentivized to improve their performance.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In this paper we estimate the short-run, long-run and overall efficiency of Norwegian 
electricity distribution companies for the period 2000–2013 controlling 
for both noise and company effects. Short-run inefficiency is the part of inefficiency 
that is allowed to adjust freely over time for each company, but long-run 
(persistent) inefficiency remains constant over time, although it is allowed to vary 
across companies. For robustness check we also consider two additional models 
in which either company effects are not controlled or these are treated as inefficiency. 
The production technology is represented by a translog input distance 
function in all three models. We find that technical change and returns to scale 
are quite robust across the models. However, the efficiency scores across the three 
models we consider are not correlated strongly. We conclude that the regulators 
and practitioners should take extra caution in using the proper model in practice, 
especially when the efficiency measures are used to reward/punish companies 
through incentives for better performance.
