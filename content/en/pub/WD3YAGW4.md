    <h1>About</h1>
    Crooke et al. conducted interviews with nine community arts practitioners from Australia, Norway, and the United States to understand how COVID-19 affected musicians' social networks. They found that social distancing disrupted local connections but increased engagement with broader networks through technology. Using Putnam’s ideas of bonding and bridging capital, they noted a shift towards decentralized communities. However, they found these concepts inadequate for describing online music connections and suggested "crystal capital" as a new way to understand the personal nature of online music engagement. This study highlights how musicians adapted to maintain their communities and connections during the pandemic, emphasizing the role of technology in fostering wider, yet more subjective, networks.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    As COVID-19-driven lockdowns and social distancing became the new normal in 2020, musicians experienced a reshuffling of their social networks. This article uses in-depth interviews with nine community arts practitioners in Australia, Norway and the United States to explore the impact of COVID-19 on their ability to practise, collaborate and connect with their musical communities. Results showed that, while social distancing has significantly disrupted active connection with localized communities and musical networks, participants reported increased connection and engagement with wider networks through technology. Applying Putnam’s concepts of bonding and bridging capital, the authors posit that COVID-era music engagement has seen a shift towards decentralized communities through an emphasis on bridging capital. Ultimately, however, analysis showed Putnam’s concepts to be unhelpful in describing online music connections, and ‘crystal capital’ is proposed as a possible way to theorize the subjective nature of online music engagement.
