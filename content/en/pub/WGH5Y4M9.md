    <h1>About</h1>
    Alvinius et al. conducted a study to understand how people from different organizations, particularly military officers, manage emotions and build confidence in civil-military collaborations. They interviewed 21 individuals with various roles in these settings. The researchers found that key aspects of successful collaboration include building and maintaining confidence, avoiding distrust, and repairing damaged confidence. They identified that boundary spanners—people who connect different groups—use specific strategies to manage emotions and meet the demands of both their own organization and their collaborators. These strategies help them adapt to challenging environments. The study highlights three types of smoothness: cultural, structural, and in risky situations, which are crucial for effective collaboration. This research adds to existing knowledge on emotional labor and self-presentation.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This study illuminates a deeper understanding of the processes of confidence building and emotion management among boundary spanners from organisations with a bureaucratic structure in a multinational civil-military operational context. Twenty-one informants (mainly military officers) were interviewed. They had a variety of experiences and occupational roles in civil-military collaboration contexts. A grounded theory analysis of interview data yielded a model according to which the most central aspects of civil-military collaboration are confidence building, maintaining existing confidence, avoiding distrust and rebuilding damaged confidence. The study shows that boundary spanners strategically utilise a variety of emotion management strategies in order to fulfil the demands laid upon them by their collaborating counterparts in the hostile environment and by their own organisation. Three interrelated dimensions of smoothness were identified: cultural, structural and smoothness in risky situations. By acting ‘smoothly’, an adaption to the dynamic environment can be achieved. The proposed model is compared to existing writings on emotional labour and self-presentation.
