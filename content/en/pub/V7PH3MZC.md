    <h1>About</h1>
    Koskela-Huotari et al. conducted a comprehensive review of 68 articles to explore how institutional theory is being used in service research. Institutions, which include long-lasting social structures like rules and norms, are becoming crucial for understanding service-related topics. They found that service research increasingly relies on institutional theory to explain how services endure and change over time. The authors created a framework to understand these stabilization and destabilization mechanisms and suggested new areas for future research. This study is important because it helps scholars better understand the role of institutions in services, guiding future research to improve service practices and policies. The review is limited to major service research and marketing journals, making it a unique and valuable resource for researchers in the field.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Purpose Service scholars are finding that institutions – enduring social structures, such as rules, norms, beliefs – are increasingly important in theorizing on service-related phenomena. The purpose of this paper is to advance the use of institutional theory in service research by synthesizing the key insights from institutional theory that have been applied to service-related phenomena and developing a research agenda to guide the future use of institutional theory in service research. Design/methodology/approach This paper is an integrative literature review covering 68 articles from major service research and marketing journals that adopt institutional concepts and frameworks to study service-related phenomena. Findings The paper maps the “institutional turn” of service research, that is, the increasing tendency to draw on institutional theory for theoretical insights within service research and builds a conceptual framework of the institutional stabilization and destabilization mechanisms that explain endurance and change in service phenomena. The paper also proposes a research agenda that outlines four previously ignored aspects of institutions that have important implications for service research. Research limitations/implications In addition to synthesizing insights and proposing directions for future research, the paper highlights specific theoretical and methodological considerations for the future use of institutional theory within service research. The literature review is limited to the 13 major service research and marketing journals. Originality/value This paper is the first literature review of the use of institutional theory in service research.
