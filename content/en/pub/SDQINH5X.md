    <h1>About</h1>
    Anderzén-Carlsson et al. conducted a study to understand the experiences of parents with deafblindness. They interviewed 14 parents, mostly mothers, aged 33 to 57. The study found that while these parents find joy in parenting, they face significant challenges due to their condition. The main theme was that parenting with deafblindness is difficult but rewarding. Parents felt competent but struggled with responsibilities and often lacked necessary support. They emphasized the need for tailored assistance from social services, healthcare, and rehabilitation to better fulfill their parental roles and actively participate in family life. This study highlights the complex reality of parenting with deafblindness and the importance of adequate support systems.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    PURPOSE To describe how parents with deafblindness experience parenting and family life. MATERIALS AND METHODS This a qualitative interview study. Fourteen parents with deafblindness were interviewed. Most were mothers (n = 10), with ages ranging between 33 and 57 years (mean 46 years). Interviews were transcribed, and the analysis was done using inductive qualitative content analysis. RESULTS The analysis resulted in the overarching theme, 'Living family life as a parent with deafblindness is not a walk in the park, but it is rewarding', and three subthemes, 'Being a competent parent despite having deafblindness', 'Needing support to fulfil my parental obligations' and 'Parenting is a struggle due to my deafblindness'. The results encompass many experiences and feelings and illustrate the complex reality of these parents in their parental role and family life. CONCLUSION The parents expressed their joy in being parents, but these feelings were intertwined with negative aspects of being unable to take on the desired responsibility or not receiving the necessary support. When requested, tailored support should be offered from social services, health care and rehabilitation services in order for parents with deafblindness to take on the parental responsibility they want and to be able to actively participate in family life.
