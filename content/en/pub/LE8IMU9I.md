    <h1>About</h1>
    Halsa examines the experiences of 14 women who are mothers and have mental health issues. They found that these women often feel trapped between societal views that label them as "deviant" and the pressure to be perfect mothers. The study highlights two main struggles: trying to appear normal and dealing with the fear of being seen as a "dangerous" mother. These mothers often blame themselves for their difficulties, feel isolated, and hesitate to ask for help. Understanding their ambivalence towards seeking help as part of their complex identity work, rather than as denial, could help professionals build better support relationships with them. This research is important because it offers insights into how to better support mothers with mental health challenges.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This article examines the experience of motherhood among 14 
women with mental health problems. The aim is to discuss the 
subjective meaning of being a mother with mental health pro- 
blems through the perspective of structural factors such as dis- 
courses on motherhood and mental illness. The article shows how 
these mothers are caught in a bind between the discourses of 
mentally ill mothers as 
“ 
deviant 
” 
and the current ideology of 
“ 
intensive mothering. 
” 
The empirical material reveals two main, 
interwoven patterns of identity work: the struggle for normality, 
and how to handle a self-identity as a 
“ 
dangerous 
” 
mother. The 
mothers understood the stress and difficulties they experienced as 
personal problems, resulting in self-blaming, feelings of loneliness, 
and a resistance towards expressing a need for help with parenting 
issues. The findings suggest that 
understanding these mothers 
’ 
ambivalence towards intervention as a kind of complex identity 
work 
— 
rather than as reluctance to receive help, or denial of their 
own problems 
— 
might be a way for professional helpers to build a 
confident relationship with mentally ill mothers.
