    <h1>About</h1>
    Deyab et al. conducted a study to investigate how anti-rheumatic treatments affect selenium levels in patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA), including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Selenium is a mineral that may help protect against heart disease, and low levels are linked to higher cardiovascular risk. The study found that selenium levels increased within six weeks of starting anti-rheumatic treatment and remained stable for six months. This increase was associated with reduced inflammation but did not show a direct link to improved heart health. The findings suggest that while anti-rheumatic drugs can boost selenium levels, more research is needed to understand their impact on heart disease risk in IA patients.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Objectives: The reason for increased cardiovascular risk in inﬂammatory arthritis (IA) is unclear. Interestingly,selenium-deﬁciency is suspected to contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the generalpopulation. Although the reference range of serum selenium (s-selenium) is 50–120 μg/L, there are indicationsthat levels up to 85 μg/L might not be suﬃcient for optimal cardioprotection. Our aim was to examine s-seleniumlevels in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), to evaluate theeﬀect of anti-rheumatic treatment on s-selenium levels, and to assess relationships between s-selenium levels andclinical and laboratory parameters including markers of disease activity and CVD risk.Methods: We examined 64 patients with RA, 40 with PsA and 26 with AS starting with methotrexate (MTX)monotherapy or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy (anti-TNF) with or without methotrexate (anti-TNF ± MTX)due to active disease. S-selenium, inﬂammatory biomarkers, endothelial function (EF) and other variables wereexamined at baseline and after 6 weeks and 6 months of treatment.Results: In the total IA group, s-selenium increased within 6 weeks of anti-rheumatic treatment, and thereafterthe levels remained stable until the end of the 6 months follow-up period. There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerencesin s-selenium changes between the three diagnostic groups and between the two treatment regimens. Changes ins-selenium were negatively related to changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR), but there were no signiﬁcant relationships to any other of the examined risk parameters for CVD includingEF.Conclusion: IA patients had s-selenium within the reference range, but below the level that might be necessaryfor optimal CVD protection.Anti-rheumatic treatment had a relatively rapid and sustained eﬀect on s-selenium levels. The increase in s-selenium was related to reduction in inﬂammatory activity. In theory, anti-rheumatic drugs might improve s-selenium levels through inhibition of pro-inﬂammatory processes or through other mechanisms. Although wehave not revealed any signiﬁcant relationships between s-selenium and CVD risk parameters, the role of sub-optimal s-selenium levels in pathogenesis of premature CVD in IA cannot be ruled out
