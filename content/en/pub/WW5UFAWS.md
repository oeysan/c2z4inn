    <h1>About</h1>
    Dahl et al. conducted a study to understand how psychological distress affects oral health among elderly people in Norway. They used data from a national survey of 949 adults aged 65 and older, examining self-rated oral health, psychological distress, and various socio-demographic factors. They found that 27% of participants reported poor oral health, and 8% had high levels of psychological distress. The study revealed that those with higher psychological distress were more likely to report poor oral health, even when factors like smoking and having fewer teeth were considered. This suggests that mental health significantly impacts oral health in older adults. The authors recommend that dental care professionals screen for psychological distress and tailor dental care information for elderly patients.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background 
There is poor knowledge about the extent to which psychological distress influences oral health in older people in Norway. The aim of this study was two-fold: i) to describe the oral health of Norwegian elderly and their levels of psychological distress; and ii) to examine the relationship of psychological distress with self-rated oral health, while controlling for oral status and socio-demographic characteristics, in Norwegian elderly. 
 
Methods 
Data were retrieved from a national cross-sectional survey conducted by Statistics Norway in 2012 and included information about self-rated oral health, psychological distress (measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25; HSCL-25), gender, age, civil status, smoking, self-reported number of teeth present and dental attendance for 949 non-institutionalised adults aged 65 years or older. Logistic regression was used to establish whether psychological distress predicts self-rated oral health, controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and oral status. 
 
Results 
Around 27% of the elderly reported having poor oral health, and 8 % had a HSCL-25 mean score ≥ 1.75, which indicates higher levels of psychological distress. Among the symptoms listed in the HSCL-25, the most frequently reported problems were lack of energy (1.7 ± 0.8) and difficulties falling and staying asleep (1.6 ± 0.7). The likelihood of reporting poor oral health was independently associated with having a mean HSCL-25 score ≥ 1.75 (OR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.14–3.15), even when smoking (OR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.17, 2.87) and having fewer than 20 teeth (OR = 3.49; 95% CI = 2.56, 4.76) were taken into account. 
 
Conclusion 
Most of the Norwegian elderly in our sample perceived themselves to have good oral health and reported relatively low levels of psychological distress. Higher levels of psychological distress can influence the oral health of the elderly independently of other factors such as smoking and having reduced number of teeth. Dental care professionals should consider screening their elderly patients for psychological distress and individualise the information about dental care for this specific population.
