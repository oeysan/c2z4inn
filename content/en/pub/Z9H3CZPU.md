    <h1>About</h1>
    Wangensteen et al. conducted a study to understand how young people feel about growing up with parents who have substance use disorder (SUD). They interviewed 12 individuals aged 13 to 26 and analyzed their experiences. The study found that these young people often have complex and conflicting emotions towards their parents, even if they no longer live with them. They struggle with deciding how often and what kind of contact to maintain with their parents. The participants expressed a need for professional support to help them manage their feelings and relationships. The authors suggest that providing adequate support to these young people is crucial for their emotional well-being and to help them navigate their relationships with their parents.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The aim of the study was to explore young people's perceptions and reflections about growing up with parents who have substance use disorder (SUD). In qualitative interviews with 12 young people (aged 13–26) and in an interpretative phenomenological analysis, we investigated their experiences of everyday life, of the relationships with the parents with SUD, and of conversations about this, both retrospectively and at the present. The findings indicated that the relationships with the parents largely occupied the informants, even when they lived separately from the parent and were protected from the daily exposure of substance use. The informants described their mixed and contradictory emotions towards their parents and the struggle to determine regulation and type of contact. They asked for professional support in order to help them cope with this. Sociocultural discourses concerning family life and substance use were discussed in an attempt to understand the findings. The findings of the study suggest that children and young people should be offered sufficient professional support in order to cope with their mixed and contradictory emotions and to determine the regularity and type of contact with the parents.
