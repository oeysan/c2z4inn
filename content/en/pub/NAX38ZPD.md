    <h1>About</h1>
    Alehagen et al. conducted a study published in the journal "Antioxidants" examining the effects of selenium and coenzyme Q10 supplements on an immune protein called CD5L in elderly individuals with low selenium levels. CD5L, which helps fight infections and is linked to heart disease and inflammation, was found to increase with supplementation. This increase was associated with improved thyroid hormone levels, better health-related quality of life, and reduced cardiovascular mortality. The study involved 359 participants over 48 months, showing that those who received the supplements had better health outcomes compared to those who took a placebo. The findings suggest that these supplements may enhance thyroid function and overall health, though further research is needed to understand the exact mechanisms.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The Cluster of Differentiation 5-like protein (CD5L) is produced by tissue-resident macrophages. It is an innate immune mediator protein with a multitude of functions, such as binding of invading microorganisms and oxidised LDL, and it is associated with clinical conditions, i.e., atherosclerosis and inflammation. The circulating CD5L level has been reported to correlate to selenium status and thyroid hormone activity. In order to test this hypothesis, we analysed CD5L in serum samples from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with selenium and coenzyme Q10 supplementation and examined associations between CD5L and thyroid hormones, health-related quality-of-life (Hr-QoL), and mortality in an elderly population low in selenium. Circulating levels of CD5L and thyroid hormones were determined in 359 elderly community-living individuals enrolled in an RCT at inclusion and after 48 months of supplementation (179 received selenium and coenzyme Q10, and 180 placebo). Hr-QoL was recorded at both time-points using Short Form 36. Pre-intervention plasma selenium was low, mean 67 µg/L. CD5L correlated positively to free tri-iodothyronine (fT3) and showed an inverse relation with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Low CD5L concentrations at inclusion in the placebo group were associated with increased cardiovascular mortality during 10 years of follow-up, and impaired Hr-QoL at 48 months. Selenium and coenzyme Q10 supplementation significantly increased CD5L and fT3 levels, in association with a better health outcome. The data indicate that circulating CD5L positively responds to selenium and coenzyme Q10 supplementation, correlates with thyroid hormone status, and associates with positive health indices. The observed effect may be due to increased selenium-dependent deiodinase isozyme expression that converts thyroxine (T4) to T3 locally and supports thyroid hormone activities. Whether the observed associations with Hr-QoL and cardiovascular mortality are a direct effect of circulating CD5L or local thyroid hormone activity is unclear and should be further investigated.
