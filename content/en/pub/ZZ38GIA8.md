    <h1>About</h1>
    Hara conducted a study on how migrant musicians in Norway develop their music careers through informal learning and self-teaching. Focusing on a DIY electronica artist, Hara explored how the musician used personal experiences and memories to navigate different musical genres and sustain their career. The study found that DIY music production can be a powerful tool for migrant musicians, especially those lacking formal music education or significant financial and social resources. By using music-making software, these artists can create and refine their music while also shaping their identities. This research highlights the potential for self-taught musicians to succeed and innovate in their careers despite initial challenges.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This paper examines informal learning in the context of migrant musicians, through a single case study looking at informal/self-learning and music career development by a DIY electronica artist. Data for the paper comes from an ethnographic study of how migrant musicians in Norway exercise their professional competence and entrepreneurship. Using the concept of the musical pathways I investigate how a migrant musician uses biographical resources to move between different musical fields to sustain a music career. A key aspect was that aesthetics in the music making process were crafted at the same time as identities, partly through re-hearing and re-collecting sounds from the past. The study indicates that there is a potential for DIY music production to develop migrant musicians’ music career when they do not have a lot of (initial) economic or social capital or a formal music education and that music making software can be valuable here.
