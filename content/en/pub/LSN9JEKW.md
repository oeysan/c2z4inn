    <h1>About</h1>
    Hagenblad et al. studied the genetic diversity of red clover in Nordic regions, focusing on two conservation methods: in situ (preserving plants in their natural habitat) and ex situ (preserving plants outside their natural habitat, like in gene banks). They analyzed seed samples from Sweden and Norway collected in 1980 and compared them with later generations and recollected samples using genetic markers. They found that the genetic diversity remained stable over time, with only minor changes. This suggests that both conservation methods are effective in maintaining genetic diversity. Limited gene flow from cultivated varieties to wild populations was detected, indicating that wild populations are mostly unaffected by nearby cultivated plants. This research helps ensure the long-term preservation of plant genetic resources.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Introduction: In situ and ex situ conservation are the two main approaches 
for preserving genetic diversity. The advantages and disadvantages of the 
two approaches have been discussed but their genetic effects have not been 
fully evaluated. 
Methods: In this study we investigate the effects of the two conservation 
approaches on genetic diversity in red clover. Seed samples collected from 
wild populations in Sweden and Norway in 1980, their subsequent generations 
created during seed regeneration at the gene bank and samples recollected from 
the same location as the original samples, were analyzed with microsatellite 
markers, alongside reference samples from cultivars. 
Results: Overall, there was a differentiation between cultivars and the wild 
material and between wild material from Sweden and Norway. In general, the 
original collections clustered together with the later generations of the same 
accession in the gene bank, and with the recollected samples from the same 
location, and the level of diversity remained the same among samples of the 
same accession. Limited gene flow from cultivated varieties to the wild 
populations was detected; however, some wild individuals are likely to be 
escapees or affected by gene flow. 
Discussion: In conclusion, there were examples of genetic changes within individual 
accessions both in situ and ex situ, as is also to be expected in any living population. 
However, we observed only limited genetic changes in both in situ and ex situ 
conservation over the generations included in this study and with the relatively large 
populations used in the ex situ conservation in the gene bank at NordGen.
