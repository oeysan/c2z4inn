    <h1>About</h1>
    Wikan conducted a study on the long-term effects of an international practicum program for Norwegian student teachers in Namibia. The program, offered by Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences, aims to enhance students' global and intercultural competence and prepare them for teaching in multicultural classrooms. Through open-ended questions sent to 18 former students, the study found that the practicum significantly impacted their personal growth and professional development. Participants reported feeling more competent in teaching global issues, having a broader worldview, and being more critical of international news. Overall, the experience helped them develop cultural sensitivity and a global perspective, which are valuable in their teaching careers.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This paper present finding from an international practicum programme for Norwegian student teachers in Namibia. Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences offers three months international practicum programme in Namibia. The aim of the programme is to expose the students to diversity, develop their global and intercultural competence and to prepare them for teaching in multicultural classrooms in Norway. This paper is the last in a series of publications from a trailing research project following student teachers that had a 3 months international practicum in the global south (Wikan and Klein, 2017, Klein and Wikan 2019). In this paper, we examine the long-term impact of the experience. Based on a qualitative study with open-ended questions mailed to 18 former students we discuss the perceived impact of their experiences both personally and professionally, with a focus on the global teacher aspect. The main finding is that the international practicum has had a significant impact on both personal growth and professional development. They report that they feel competent to teach in a multicultural classroom, teach global issues, have broaden their worldview and global knowledge and have become more critical towards international news due to their own three months experience in Namibia. In conclusion, they have developed a cultural sensitivity and 
global perspective in their role as a teacher.
