    <h1>About</h1>
    Monclús et al. studied the presence of harmful chemicals in the feathers of Eurasian eagle-owls in Norway. They looked at both old and new types of organohalogenated compounds (OHCs), which include substances like PCBs, pesticides, and flame retardants. By analyzing feathers collected from different regions and years, they found that the levels of these chemicals varied by location and time. Southern Norway had higher levels of certain chemicals compared to other areas. The study also used carbon and nitrogen isotopes to understand the owls' diet, finding that diet influenced some chemical levels. This research is important because it shows that these chemicals, which can harm wildlife, are still present in top predators like eagle-owls, indicating ongoing environmental risks.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The occurrence of organohalogenated compounds (OHCs) in wildlife has received considerable attention over the  
last decades. Among the matrices used for OHCs biomonitoring, feathers are particularly useful as they can be  
collected in a minimally or non-invasive manner. In this study, concentrations of various legacy OHCs  
–polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers  
(PBDEs)–, as well as emerging OHCs –per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and organophosphate ester  
flame retardants (OPEs)– were determined in feathers of 72 Eurasian eagle-owls (Bubo bubo) from Norway, with  
the goal of studying spatiotemporal variation using a non-invasive approach. Molted feathers were collected at  
nest sites from northern, central and southern Norway across four summers (2013–2016). Additionally, two  
museum-archived feathers from 1979 to 1989 were included. Stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen isotopes (δ15N)  
were used as dietary proxies. In total, 11 PFAS (sum range 8.25–215.90 ng g− 1), 15 PCBs (4.19–430.01 ng g− 1), 6  
OCPs (1.48–220.94 ng g− 1), 5 PBDEs (0.21–5.32 ng g− 1) and 3 OPEs (4.49–222.21 ng g− 1) were quantified.  
While we observed large variation in the values of both stable isotopes, suggesting a diverse diet of the eagle owls,  
only δ13C seemed to explain variation in PFAS concentrations. Geographic area and year were influential factors for  
δ15N and δ13C. Considerable spatial variation was observed in PFAS levels, with the southern  
area showing higher levels compared to northern and central Norway. For the rest of OHCs, we observed  
between-year variations; sum concentrations of PCBs, OCPs, PBDEs and OPEs reached a maximum in 2015 and  
2016. Concentrations from 1979 to 1989 were within the ranges observed between 2013 and 2016. Overall, our  
data indicate high levels of legacy and emerging OHCs in a top predator in Norway, further highlighting the risk  
posed by OHCs to wildlife.
