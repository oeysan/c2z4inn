    <h1>About</h1>
    Khanal et al. conducted a study on onion farmers in India to understand how their attitudes towards risk influence their decisions on managing risks. They found that farmers who are more risk-averse (cautious about taking risks) are more likely to diversify their crops, use recommended seed varieties, and adopt practices to prevent diseases and pests. Conversely, farmers who are less risk-averse tend to avoid these risk management strategies. Additionally, farmers who perceive higher risks of poor-quality production or crop loss due to weather and pests are less likely to adopt good agricultural practices. These findings are important because they help explain how farmers' attitudes and perceptions can impact their farming decisions, which can affect their productivity and income.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Using primary survey data of onion growers in India, this study tests the relationship and predictability of risk attitude measures on farmers’ undertaking of various risk management decisions. Findings suggest that risk management decisions like diversification, adopting good agricultural practices, quality-enhancing practices, and participation in off-farm work are likely to decrease with decreasing risk-aversion. High-risk-averse farmers are more likely to adopt farm diversification strategies, good agricultural practices, governmentrecommended seed varieties and preventive measures against diseases & pests than low-riskaverse farmers. The likelihood of adopting good agricultural practices decreases with farmers’ perceived higher risks of low-quality production, a higher risk of losing crops due to weather, and insects and pests.
