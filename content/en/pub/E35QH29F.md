    <h1>About</h1>
    De Rubeis et al. studied how sensitivity to rejection (RS) affects depression in men. They found that men who are more sensitive to rejection are likely to experience worsening depressive symptoms after treatment. This study involved 72 male patients with depression, tracking their symptoms over six months. The researchers discovered that RS could predict the severity of depression later on, even after accounting for initial symptom levels. This finding is important because it suggests that addressing rejection sensitivity during therapy could help prevent relapse. The authors recommend further research to explore other factors that might influence this relationship, such as self-blame and low self-esteem. This study highlights the need for ongoing support and targeted treatment for men with depression.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Consistent across time and cultures, men and male adolescents older than 14 years of age appear underrepresented in mood disorders, and are far less likely than women to seek psychological help. The much higher rate of suicide amongst males suggests that depression in men might be underreported. One of the core human motives is to seek acceptance by others and avoid rejection. Rejection Sensitivity (RS) has been conceptualized as the cognitive-affective processing disposition to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely respond to cues of rejection in the behavior of others. RS has been previously linked with the onset and course of depression, but—as yet—has not been investigated longitudinally in a clinical population. We investigated the predictive role of RS to symptom deterioration 6 months after end-of- treatment in 72 male inpatients with depressive spectrum disorder. The BDI was administered at intake, end-of-treatment and 6 month follow-up. RS scores were obtained at intake. Rejection Sensitivity had additional predictive power on BDI scores at 6 months follow-up controlling for BDI scores at end-of-treatment (ΔR2 = .095). The results are discussed in terms of the importance of targeting RS during treatment, and highlight the fact that therapeutic follow-up care is paramount. Future research should investigate possible mediators of the RS–relapse-to-depression association, such as self-blame, rumination, neuroticism, pessimism, emotion dysregulation, and low self-esteem.
