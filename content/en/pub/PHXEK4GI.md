    <h1>About</h1>
    Sørås and Snipstad examined the impact of coercion in psychiatric care on patients. They found that being treated as objects rather than individuals can lead to long-term negative effects, such as trauma, reluctance to seek future treatment, and loss of self-confidence. When patients are involuntarily admitted and treated impersonally, they may either objectify the professionals in return or start to believe they are truly sick, which can make them doubt their own sanity. The authors argue for an ethical approach in psychiatric care that respects both patients and healthcare workers as knowledgeable individuals. This approach could help build trust and improve the overall treatment experience for patients.

    Abstract 
Coercion in psychiatric care may cause long-term negative effects such as trauma, reluctance to seek later treatment, as well as erosion of self-confidence and trust in one’s own feelings and thoughts. Based on data from a previous study and the theoretical framework developed by Hans Skjervheim, this article discusses how experiences with coercion may appear as a result of how the patients are approached and defined when involuntarily admitted. If patients admitted to involuntary psychiatric care are treated as objects they might respond by objectifying the professionals back or succumbing to the descriptions of themselves as sick. The latter may ultimately cause them to question their own sanity. In light of this, this paper argues that there is a need for an ongoing ethical discussion on how to find common ground between patients and health care workers, where both are viewed as subjects with knowledge and opinions worthy of respect.
