    <h1>About</h1>
    Beebe and Dellsén conducted a study examining the beliefs of researchers from seven scientific fields, as well as history and philosophy of science, about scientific realism. Scientific realism is the idea that scientific theories describe the world as it truly is. They found that natural scientists (like biologists and physicists) were more likely to believe in scientific realism compared to social scientists (like sociologists). Scholars in history and philosophy of science were more likely to be skeptical about scientific realism. Additionally, they discovered that one specific definition of scientific realism did not align with more common definitions. Interestingly, those who believed in the pessimistic induction (the idea that past scientific theories have been proven wrong) were not necessarily more skeptical about scientific realism. This study helps us understand how different fields view the nature of scientific knowledge.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    We report the results of a study that investigated the views of researchers working in seven scientific disciplines and in history and philosophy of science in regard to four hypothesized dimensions of scientific realism. Among other things, we found (i) that natural scientists tended to express more strongly realist views than social scientists, (ii) that history and philosophy of science scholars tended to express more antirealist views than natural scientists, (iii) that van Fraassen’s characterization of scientific realism failed to cluster with more standard characterizations, and (iv) that those who endorsed the pessimistic induction were no more or less likely to endorse antirealism.
