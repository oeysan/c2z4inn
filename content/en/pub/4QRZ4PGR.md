    <h1>About</h1>
    Mehlhoop et al. conducted a study on restoring disturbed alpine ecosystems by transplanting vegetation turfs in central Norway. They found that time is the most crucial factor for vegetation recovery, but soil conditions also play a significant role. Specifically, areas with silt-dominated soil and organic matter showed almost double the species richness and vegetation cover compared to coarser soils without organic matter. After 14 years, the species composition in transplanted turfs and their surroundings was very similar. The study highlights the importance of preparing restoration sites with fine soil and organic content to speed up recovery. These findings are essential for setting realistic expectations for ecosystem recovery and improving restoration practices.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Questions: Restoration of disturbed alpine ecosystems is difficult due to harsh environmental conditions. Transplanting of vegetation turfs into disturbed areas has  
been used as a restoration method in disturbed alpine sites. The aim of this study is to investigate which environmental factors influence the vegetation recovery in turf  
surroundings and how turf attributes contribute to vegetation recovery. 
Location: Restored roads in a former military training area, Dovrefjell mountain range, central Norway. 
Methods: We recorded species richness, vegetation cover and soil characteristics of  
transplanted turfs and turf surroundings in roads restored between 3 and 14 years ago.Linearandgeneralizedlinearmixedmodelswereusedtoinvestigatetherelative 
importance of turf attributes and soil factors for recovery of turf surroundings. 
Results: Time was the most important factor for vegetation recovery, but soil conditions in turf surroundings were also highly important. Species richness and vegetation cover in turf surroundings were almost twice as high on silt dominated soil and  with presence of soil organic matter compared to on coarser soils and without organic matter. Species richness in turfs and turf surroundings was almost equal after 14years,andthesimilarityofthespeciescompositionwashigh.Neitherturfsize, 
distance to the second closest turf or species richness and vegetation cover of the turfs were important factors for vegetation recovery in the turf surroundings. 
Conclusion: This study demonstrates the importance of preparing the restoration  sites before using turf transplants in road and infrastructure restoration. Of particularimportanceisensuringsoilorganiccontentandafinesoilgrainsizetoincreaserates of vegetation recovery in short time scales. Time is the most important factor  for recovery in this ecosystem, and this should be communicated to project owners  
andtothepublictoensurerealisticexpectationsonrecoverytime.
