    <h1>About</h1>
    Bashir et al. conducted a study on forest management plans (FMP) for non-industrial private forest owners in Norway. They surveyed these owners to understand how they acquire, familiarize themselves with, and implement FMPs. The study found that 37% of these owners have an FMP, with 66% of them being knowledgeable about its content and 40% actively implementing its proposals. Key factors influencing familiarity and use of FMPs include previous harvests, the size of productive areas, advice from public management, awareness of public support for forestry, and the perceived relevance of the FMP. The authors suggest that better information dissemination and emphasizing the importance of FMPs can enhance their effectiveness as tools for forest management and policy.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Forest management plans (FMP) are key decision-support tools for forest managers and a central policy instrument in many countries. Despite its pivotal importance in forest management, there is a lack of studies that analyze the acquisition, familiarity and implementation of the FMP. These steps collectively contribute to making FMP a successful decision-support tool and forest policy instrument. We surveyed a sample representative of the population of Norwegian non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners to quantify the importance of a broad set of factors, including ownership objectives, socio-demographic, property and information sources variables on the FMP pathway, i.e. acquisition of FMP, awareness of its content and implementation of the plans’ proposals. Applying principal component analysis on twelve ownership objectives, we found that most forest owners are multiobjective. We combined conditional classification trees and logistic regression analyses on the FMP pathway to unveil familiarity and use of FMP in forest owner subgroups as well as individual drivers. The results indicate that 37% of Norwegian NIPF owners have a FMP. Among the owners having FMP, 66% have good knowledge of its content and 40% implement its proposals. The strongest variables to predict FMP familiarity and use were previous harvests, productive area, advice about forestry from the public management, knowledge of public support schemes for forestry and perceived relevance of the FMP. We conclude that FMP suppliers, consultants, forestry bureaucracy and policy-makers should emphasize information dissemination and relevance of the FMP to increase its success as a decision-support tool and forest policy instrument.
