    <h1>About</h1>
    Taheri et al. explored how brain-computer interface (BCI) technology can measure pain by recording and analyzing brain activity. They combined BCI with virtual reality (VR) to create a simulation that monitors a patient's pain experience and assists with therapy. This innovative approach allows patients to interact with the simulation using their brain activity and receive real-time feedback. The study suggests that BCI can provide precise measurements of pain, potentially identifying neural patterns linked to pain. This could lead to personalized therapy strategies, offering a safe and controlled environment for patients to manage their pain through activities like meditation and relaxation exercises. The combination of BCI and VR has the potential to transform pain detection and relief.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology can be used to measure pain. Brain activity is recorded and analyzed using BCI devices. The use of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology for pain measurement is an area of ongoing research and development. While there is no single definitive proof at this time, there is a growing body of evidence and research that supports the idea that BCI technology can provide objective and precise measurements of the pain. BCI enables researchers to observe and evaluate pain-related neural activity real-time. This could lead to the identification of neural patterns linked with pain, which could then be used to develop personalized therapy strategies for each patient. Furthermore, we could combine this technology with VR to make a simulation that can monitor the patient's pain experience and assist with further therapy. This will provide a safe and controlled environment for patients to better understand their pain by allowing patients to interact simulation elements using their brain activity and get real-time feedback. Overall, the combination of brain-computer interface and virtual reality technology has immense potential to revolutionize the way we detect and ease pain. The aim is to develop a simulation that provides patients with an immersive and interactive environment, allowing them to engage in activities that can help manage their pain, such as meditation, relaxation exercises, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. In this study, authors worked on a method to show how pain can be detected and visualized and used in the simulation.
