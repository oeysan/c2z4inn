    <h1>About</h1>
    Themsen et al. conducted a study on how project accounting influences the success of large-scale construction projects, specifically the building of 16 new public hospitals in Denmark. They found that while project accounting helped manage hospital designs and guided decision-making, it also forced compromises when unexpected issues arose. These compromises often resulted in hospitals that did not fully meet the needs of the receiving hospital organizations, affecting cost structures and patient care quality. This study highlights the complex role of project accounting, showing it can both support and hinder the achievement of project goals. Understanding this dual impact is crucial for improving how large projects are managed and ensuring they deliver relevant and effective outcomes.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    PurposeThis paper aims to advance recent literature on the performativity of accounting by examining how project accounting affects a project organization’s ability to deliver a relevant project outcome, such as a product or a building, for a receiving client organization.Design/methodology/approachThe paper draws on a longitudinal case study of a 41.4-billion-kroner (5.5-billion-euro) Danish project of constructing 16 new public hospitals. Its objective was to reduce the average unit costs and improve the quality of patient care. Each hospital construction was managed by a separate project organization and handed over to a separate receiving hospital organization. The project organizations applied a common approach to project accounting. The paper relies on Michel Callon’s concepts of performativity and sociotechnical agencement – approaching project accounting as an arrangement of devices.FindingsThe paper shows that the project-accounting agencement simultaneously supported and undermined the project organizations’ ability to deliver hospitals relevant to the receiving hospital organizations. The agencement performed hospital designs, disciplined project actors and guided decision-making, thus supporting the overall work of the project organizations. It also, however, compelled the project organizations to compromise on hospital designs when unexpected events occurred. These compromises led to the delivery of hospitals, which largely prevented the receiving hospital organizations from achieving the project’s objective.Originality/valueThis paper advances our limited understanding of the dynamic and complex relationship between project accounting and the relevance of project outcomes. It introduces the concept of a “contronymity device” to capture the way project accounting simultaneously produces two opposing consequences, both supporting and undermining the enactment of a particular reality. The paper lastly enriches our understanding of how project-accounting devices impact hospital organizations’ operating cost structures and challenge patient care capabilities.
