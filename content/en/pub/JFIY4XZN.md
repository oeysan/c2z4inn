    <h1>About</h1>
    Fathabadi et al. conducted a study to compare blood lead levels (BLLs) between patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and healthy individuals. They found that people with AD had significantly higher levels of lead in their blood compared to those without the disease. This matters because lead exposure might be a factor in the development of AD, which is a condition that affects memory and thinking. The study suggests that reducing lead exposure could potentially help in preventing or managing Alzheimer’s disease. The research was carried out on patients with cognitive impairment at a neurological clinic, and the findings highlight the importance of environmental factors in brain health.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background: It is argued that breakdown of β-amyloid in the brain causes deposition of senescent plaques and therefore Alzheimer’s disease (AD). One of the influential factors for increasing level of this protein is exposure to lead. Our aim was to compare blood lead levels (BLLs) between patients with AD and healthy controls. Methods: This case–control study was performed on all patients with cognitive impairment who were referred to the Neurological Clinic of Birjand in 2016 to 2017. Patients were referred to the laboratory for measurement of their serum levels of lead. The controls and patients were matched by age and sex. Results: In the AD case group, the average BLL was 22.22 ± 28.57 μg/dL. Mann-Whitney U test showed that BLLs were significantly higher in the patients than in the controls. The unadjusted odds ratio for BLL among the patients was 1.05 (95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.09; P = .01) compared to the controls. Conclusion: In the present study, BLL was associated with AD.
