    <h1>About</h1>
    Rinde et al. conducted a study to understand how children with cerebral palsy (CP) and their parents experience pain management differently. They interviewed 14 children with CP and one parent of each child separately. The study found that children and parents have varying views on pain management strategies, which include self-care, psychological methods, physical interventions, and professional treatments. Children reported using psychological strategies more often, while parents mentioned professional treatments more frequently. These differences highlight the importance of considering both perspectives to fully understand and address the pain management needs of children with CP. This insight can help improve pain management approaches and ensure that both children and parents are supported effectively.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Aim: The aim of this study is to explore and compare experiences of pain management 
strategies for children with CP from the perspectives of children themselves and their parents. 
 
Methods: A secondary inductive analysis of previously collected qualitative data was performed. 
Fourteen children with CP and one parent of each child were interviewed separately about the 
management of the child’s pain. A dyadic data analysis was used to compare parents’ and children’s 
perspectives. 
 
Findings: The main thematic categories of pain management identified were self-care, 
psychological strategies, physical interventions and professional treatment. Experiences described by 
the child and parent differed within all participating dyads but to different degrees. On a group level, 
children described more use of psychological strategies than parents did. Parents described more 
professional treatment strategies.  
 
Conclusions: Parents and children described different experiences 
of pain management strategies, and both perspectives are needed to understand the child’s situation
