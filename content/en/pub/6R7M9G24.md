    <h1>About</h1>
    Drożdżowicz's journal paper explores how communication in mental healthcare settings can be unfair to patients. Often, patients aren't listened to or taken seriously, which is called "epistemic injustice." This means they aren't seen as knowledgeable by healthcare professionals. The study looks at how the roles of healthcare workers affect communication and the pressures they face in conversations. It uses Goldberg's idea of "conversational pressures," which are the challenges people face when talking in professional settings. The paper suggests that the roles of healthcare workers influence how conversations are judged and highlights the need for more research on how ethical and knowledge-related factors affect communication in mental healthcare.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    What do we owe to each other when communicating? One area where these questions become immediately relevant is that of mental healthcare settings. Mental healthcare relies heavily on communication with patients/clients. However, it has been argued that patients/clients in mental healthcare settings are often vulnerable to various forms of epistemic injustice, e.g., by not being listened to, not being taken seriously, not being considered as a source of knowledge by healthcare professionals (e.g., Crichton et al., 2017; Scrutton, 2017; Kurs &amp; Grinshpoon 2018; Kidd, Spencer&amp; Carel 2023). The paper investigates normative aspects of communication in settings where interlocutors occupy specific social and professional roles. I focus on the conversational pressures account, recently proposed by Goldberg (2020), and communicative interactions in mental healthcare settings, where issues of epistemic injustice and deficient communication are of great importance. I suggest that professional roles in mental healthcare settings have an impact on the normative evaluation of interlocutors, as well as the conversational pressures they are under. I discuss whether and to what extent ethical and epistemic features of the social and professional contexts can be seen as providing a direct normative source for conversational pressures. I close by sketching a map of issues that require further investigation.
