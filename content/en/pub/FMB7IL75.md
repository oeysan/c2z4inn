    <h1>About</h1>
    Paulsen and Hjertø conducted a study to understand how school principals in Norway improve their leadership skills by participating in municipal school district leader teams. They analyzed data from 854 school principals across 252 teams using various statistical methods. The study found that the most significant factor for principals' learning was a supportive group climate within these teams. Trust in the superintendent and having a competent municipal school owner also contributed to their professional development. The research emphasizes the importance of creating a supportive and risk-free environment for school leaders and highlights the role of competent school owners in fostering effective learning systems. This study provides valuable insights into how school district administrators can enhance the professional growth of school principals.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The purpose of this paper is to investigate how school principals’ leadership competence is enhanced by participation in municipal school district leader teams in the Norwegian context.,The study investigated a field sample of 854 school principals working in 252 municipal school leader teams. Hypotheses were developed and tested by using multiple regressions and structural equation modeling; whereas individual- and group-level effects were tested using a hierarchical linear modeling approach. Moderator analyses where undertaken.,The results indicate that a supportive group climate in school leader teams is the strongest predictor of the principals’ learning outcomes. Moreover, trust to the superintendent and having a competent municipal school owner apparatus also predicted this form of professional development. Moderator analysis provides supplementary insights by showing that the positive effect of a trusting relationship to superintendents is contingent of a competent school owner.,The study reinforces the crucial importance of school superintendents creating a supportive and risk-free learning climate within their team of school leaders. The study underscores the importance of a competent school owner in Norwegian municipalities and the study places emphasis on a trusting relationship between school principals and their immediate superintendent.,The study highlights the importance that school district administrators develop municipal school leader teams toward effective learning system through internal competence development and a supportive group climate.,The study provides empirical evidence regarding the complex dynamics involved in the professional development of school principals in district leadership teams.
