    <h1>About</h1>
    Osgood's edited collection, "Postfoundational Approaches to Qualitative Inquiry," explores innovative research methods that go beyond traditional critiques. The book introduces various postfoundational frameworks from the humanities and sciences, focusing on new ways of understanding and engaging with research. These approaches are described as emergent, relational, responsive, involuntary, and inventive, aiming to inspire new connections rather than establish fixed methods. The authors discuss theories like poststructuralism, posthumanism, and feminist new materialism, among others, to provoke fresh perspectives and ideas. Organized into four thematic sections, the book offers practical examples to help readers explore uncharted territories in research. It serves as a valuable resource for advanced qualitative inquiry courses or as a supplementary text for studying theoretical applications in research.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Postfoundational Approaches to Qualitative Inquiry is an edited collection that aims to move beyond a critique and deconstruction of method in order to present an engagement with various postfoundational frameworks and approaches that produce new concepts and enactments. What makes this book innovative is the singular focus on postfoundational paradigms, borrowed from the humanities and sciences, that are enveloped in what is referred to as the ontological turn, the new empiricisms, and the new materialisms. 
 
Postfoundational inquiry is conceived by the editors as emergent, relational, responsive, involuntary, and inventive. While the editors name the facets of these contingent approaches and explain how they work, they do so not in order to fix a new method, but to spur new connectives. In this collection, authors take up a range of postfoundational theories such as poststructuralism, posthumanism, postcolonialism, feminist new materialism, speculative/ new empiricism, agential realism, immanent ontologies, and affect theory. Provoked by a series of reorienting questions, chapters in the book offer enactments as a way of unfurling what is unthought, not yet, and becoming. The chapters are organized according to four Openings: Atmospheres, Affects, and Hauntings; Archives, Worldings, and Sketchings; Escaping Tradition, Beginning Elsewhere, and the Politics of Doing Otherwise; Pre-personal Agencies and Thought Taking Flight. 
 
This book can be used as a standalone text in advanced qualitative inquiry courses, or as a supplementary text in courses that examine the use of theory in research
