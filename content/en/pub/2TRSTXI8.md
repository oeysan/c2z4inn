    <h1>About</h1>
    Caldeborg et al. conducted a review of research on physical contact between adults and children in educational settings like sports coaching, physical education, and preschools. They found that over the past 20 years, the number of studies on this topic has grown significantly, covering various countries and journals. Key themes in the research include concerns about physical contact, cultural differences, and the role of touch in teaching. The authors highlight that while physical contact can be an important teaching tool, it also raises fears and resistance among educators. They suggest future research should explore how these fears affect teaching practices and consider intersectionality, which looks at how different social categories like race, gender, and class interact and impact experiences. This research is important for understanding and improving educational practices involving physical contact.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Physical contact between adults and children in educational setting has been a well debated subject in research over the past 20 years. Although physical contact is often regarded as an important pedagogical tool, it has given rise to an increased awareness amongst sports coaches, physical education and preschool teachers about the possible negative consequences of its use in these settings. The aim of this article is to map the current literature on physical contact in physical education, sports coaching and the preschool and identify research gaps by means of a scoping review, i.e. after 20 years of research in the field of intergenerational touch what can be said to be known in the field and what possible gaps are there in the research? The research questions are: (i) Which journals, countries, settings, theories and methods are represented in the research field? (ii) Which central themes and knowledge gaps can be identified? The results show that the research field has expanded significantly in the last 20 years, both in terms of the number of published articles, the number of countries represented in the research and the number of journals in which articles on the topic have been published. The central themes identified in the articles included in the review cover the following topics: fears related to physical contact, resistance, cultural differences, the functions and needs of physical contact and the professional identity of sports coaches, physical education and preschool teachers. It is concluded that studies that could lead the research field forward would ideally focus on intersectionality, or how practitioners’ fears of physical contact impact their pedagogical work with students.
