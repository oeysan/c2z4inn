    <h1>About</h1>
    Stensen et al. conducted a study to see how well childcare providers can identify preschool children at risk for mental health problems compared to a standardized tool called the Caregiver-Teacher Report Form (C-TRF). They looked at 1430 children aged one to six years old from 57 childcare centers. The study found that while childcare providers' concerns should be taken seriously and followed up with further screening or assessment, their nominations often included many false positives. This means that using a reliable screening tool alongside providers' concerns could help confirm or rule out potential issues more accurately. This approach can help childcare providers act more effectively and ensure children get the support they need.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Childcare providers are vanguards in identifying children at risk for mental health problems. Thus, the aim of the current study was to investigate the accuracy of childcare providers’ nominations of children at risk for mental health problems against a well-established comparator, the CaregiverTeacher Report Form. Findings from the present study, including 1430 
children aged one to six years old and 169 childcare providers from 57 childcare centers, indicates that nominations in the form of concerns should be taken seriously and followed up with additional screening or assessment and consideration for referral. However, nominations also created a considerable portion of false positives. These results suggest that when childcare providers become concerned about a child, it may be beneficial to apply a psychometrically sound screening instrument to decrease the rate of false positive nominations. This may help childcare providers to act more promptly by confirming or discarding their initial 
concerns.
