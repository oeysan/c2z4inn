    <h1>About</h1>
    Hagerup et al. conducted a study to understand how the physical spaces where psychotherapy occurs affect the therapy process. They interviewed six psychologists and two psychiatrists to gather insights. The study found that the design of therapy spaces, including elements of nature, plays a significant role in therapy. Three main themes emerged: using design as a therapeutic tool, nature acting as a co-therapist, and expanding the therapeutic space. These findings suggest that therapy environments are not just passive settings but can actively influence the therapy experience for both therapists and patients. This research highlights the importance of thoughtfully designed therapy spaces in enhancing the effectiveness of psychotherapy.

    Introduction The study aims to examine psychologists’ and psychiatrists’ experiences of built environments, indoors and outdoors, in providing psychotherapy. The research explores how the environment matters in clinical practice from the perspective of psychologists and psychiatrists and seeks to comprehend the significance of the facilities where psychotherapy takes place. Methods This study design is explorative and qualitative. Data is generated by eight in-depth interviews with six clinical psychologists and two psychiatrists and was analyzed using an interpretative phenomenological approach. Results Our findings revealed that the built environment matters in clinical practice as it appears to be closely linked to fostering a more comprehensive approach and facilitating various associations and themes in psychotherapy. Three superordinate themes emerged from the data: Design as therapeutic tool, Nature as a co-therapist, and lastly, Expanding the therapeutic space, highlights the participants’ perspective on the transformative potential of the built environment to become therapeutic. Conclusion The findings reveal how built environments can be actively utilized as tools in psychotherapy. Environments are not to be considered merely as neutral and passive spaces for conducting and receiving psychotherapy rather than experienced as places that may regulate and impact both therapists and patients, the relationship between them.
