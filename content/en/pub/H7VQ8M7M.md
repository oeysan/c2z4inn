    <h1>About</h1>
    Benediktsson conducted a study on Icelandic student teachers' views about supporting cultural and linguistic diversity in schools. They found that while student teachers appreciate and use culturally responsive teaching methods, their grasp of the related theories varies. This inconsistency is partly due to their personal interests and areas of specialization within their education programs. The study highlights the importance of better preparing teachers to handle diverse classrooms, which can help reduce prejudice and improve cooperation with parents from different cultural backgrounds. This research matters because it suggests that teacher education programs need to be more effective in teaching these concepts to ensure all students receive equitable and inclusive education.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The pupil population has become more diverse in Icelandic schools. However, there remains a need for teachers to be better prepared to work in this changing context. Drawing on critical multiculturalism, multicultural education theory, and tenets of culturally responsive teaching, this paper explores student teachers’ perspectives on various methods which support cultural and linguistic diversity, challenge prejudice, and promote cooperation with parents from diverse cultural backgrounds. The findings indicate that the student teachers value culturally responsive teaching methods and have been able to utilise them to some extent in practice. However, despite the preparation received from their teacher education programmes, their understandings of the theoretical constructs are inconsistent and influenced by personal interests and specialisation within the programme.
