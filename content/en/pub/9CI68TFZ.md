    <h1>About</h1>
    Bjørklund et al. reviewed the use of certain chemicals, called metal chelators, to treat poisoning from lead, mercury, and arsenic. They found that DMSA, a type of chelator, is safer and less toxic than older treatments like BAL and DMPS. For moderate lead poisoning, DMSA is recommended over CaEDTA due to fewer side effects. In severe cases, combining DMSA with another substance, Monensin, might help remove lead from the body more effectively. DMSA and DMPS are also promising for mercury poisoning, while DMPS is better for arsenic poisoning. The authors suggest that combining low doses of BAL with DMPS could improve treatment by helping the body excrete these metals more quickly. This research is important for improving treatments for heavy metal poisoning.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This article reviews the clinical use of the 
metal chelators sodium 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate 
(DMPS), meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 
and calcium disodium edetate (CaEDTA, calcium EDTA) 
in overexposure and poisonings with salts of lead (Pb), 
mercury (Hg), and arsenic (As). DMSA has considerably 
lower toxicity than the classic heavy metal antagonist BAL 
(2,3-dimercaptopropanol) and is also less toxic than DMPS. 
Because of its adverse efects, CaEDTA should be replaced 
by DMSA as the antidote of choice in treating moderate Pb 
poisoning. Combination therapy with BAL and CaEDTA 
was previously recommended in cases of severe acute Pb 
poisoning with encephalopathy. We suggest that BAL in 
such cases acted as a shuttling Pb transporter from the intrato 
the extracellular space. The present paper discusses if a 
combination of the extracellularly distributed DMSA with 
the ionophore, Monensin may provide a less toxic combination 
for Pb mobilization by increasing both the efux of 
intracellularly deposited Pb and the urinary Pb excretion. 
Anyhow, oral therapy with DMSA should be continued with 
several intermittent courses. DMPS and DMSA are also 
promising antidotes in Hg poisoning, whereas DMPS seems 
to be a more efcient agent against As poisoning. However, 
new insight indicates that a combination of low-dosed BAL  
plus DMPS could be a preferred antidotal therapy to obtain 
mobilization of the intracerebral deposits into the circulation for subsequent rapid urinary excretion.
