    <h1>About</h1>
    Kuria et al. conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether selenium, a mineral found in food, can help protect against cancer. They analyzed 37 studies out of 2,564 articles and found that consuming selenium at recommended levels (≥55 μg/day) can reduce the risk of cancer. This protective effect was particularly noted in men and when selenium was taken as a supplement. The study showed that higher selenium intake is linked to lower overall cancer risk, even after considering factors like age, body weight, and smoking habits. These findings suggest that including selenium in your diet might help lower the chances of developing cancer, although the impact can vary depending on the type of cancer.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Current evidence on selenium and its effects on cancer is conflicting. This study aimed at assessing the association between dietary intake of selenium and incidence of cancers by performing systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based prospective studies. We systematically searched for articles in Medline (Ovid), Embase, Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database and VIP Chinese Scientific Journals. Analysis was performed in Stata version 14.2. Of the 2,564 articles obtained from the databases, 39 met our inclusion criteria, 37 were included in the final analysis. Selenium at recommended daily allowance levels of ≥55 μg/day decreased the risk of cancer [relative risk (RR) = 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.90–0.98]. A protective effect was found in men at levels ≥55 μg/day (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94–0.99). Extra selenium intake from supplements was protective at levels ≥55 μg/day (RR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.82–0.97). There was an inverse relationship (p value = 0.020) between selenium intake and overall cancer risk after adjusting for age, body mass index, and smoking but there was no evidence of nonlinear relationship (p value = 0.261). The findings in this study suggest that selenium is protective against cancer however the effects vary with different cancers.
