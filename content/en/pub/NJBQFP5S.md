    <h1>About</h1>
    Happell et al. conducted a study to understand how nursing students' attitudes towards mental health nursing are influenced by teaching led by Experts by Experience. These experts, who have personal experience with mental health issues, played a significant role in the education of nursing students from five European countries and Australia. The study found that after this specialized teaching, students had more positive views about mental health nursing. They realized that mental health is a universal concern, felt they became better practitioners, and gained a greater appreciation for the field of mental health nursing. This shift in attitude is crucial for providing high-quality mental health care across all healthcare settings.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background: Mental health nursing skills and knowledge are vital for the provision of high-quality healthcare across all settings. Negative attitudes of nurses, towards both mental illness and mental health nursing as a profession, limit recognition of the value of these skills and knowledge. Experts by Experience have a significant role in enhancing mental health nursing education. The impact of this involvement on attitudes to mental health nursing has not been well researched. 
 
Aim: To explore the impact of Expert by Experience-led teaching on students’ perceptions of mental health nursing. 
 
Methods: Qualitative exploratory study involving focus groups with nursing students from five European countries and Australia. 
 
Results: Following Expert by Experience-led teaching, participants described more positive views towards mental health nursing skills and knowledge in three main ways: learning that mental health is everywhere, becoming better practitioners, and better appreciation of mental health nursing. 
 
Conclusions: Experts by experience contribute to promoting positive attitudinal change in nursing students towards mental health nursing skills and knowledge. Attitudinal change is essential for the provision of high-quality mental health care in specialist mental health services and throughout the healthcare sector.
