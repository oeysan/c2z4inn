    <h1>About</h1>
    Saul's chapter explores the role of the right to self-determination in situations where territories are occupied for extended periods, focusing on Palestinian territories. The study first explains how this right functions within international law, both as part of the law of occupation and as an independent legal principle. It then examines the specific case of Palestinian territories, considering factors like the Oslo Accords, conditions in Gaza, population movement, and resource use. Saul highlights the importance of distinguishing between the two functions of self-determination and discusses the legal consequences of denying this right. The chapter argues that self-determination is crucial for protecting international community interests, providing legal safeguards against domination in prolonged occupations. This understanding helps clarify complex legal situations and ensures fundamental principles remain effective.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    How should we understand the function of the right to self-determination in situations of prolonged occupation? To shed light on this question, the first part of this chapter examines doctrine on the meaning of the right in international law and its relation to the law of occupation. It explains how the right to self-determination may serve as part of the law of occupation’s interpretative framework, but also as a standalone component of the international legal framework for prolonged occupations. The second part of this chapter examines the prolonged occupation of Palestinian territory from the perspective of the right to self-determination. Specific attention is given to the Oslo Accords, circumstances in Gaza, population movement, and natural resource usage. The analysis brings more fully into focus the distinct nature of the two functions of the right to self-determination and illustrates the importance of keeping them separate. The third part of the chapter examines the legal consequences that follow from denying the right to self-determination. The focus is on the right’s importance for the international community of states and the obligations this generates. 
The chapter argues that when circumstances add complexity and uncertainty to the operation of a specialised legal regime, it is important to recognise that fundamental principles of international law continue to operate as a baseline securing protection of international community interests. The right to self-determination as a precept of non-domination provides legal protection in situations of prolonged occupation regardless of the haze that can form around the meaning and application of the law of occupation.
