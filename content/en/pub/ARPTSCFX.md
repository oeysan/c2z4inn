    <h1>About</h1>
    Ede et al. explore how poetry can help people understand and address environmental issues in their book. They show that writing, reading, and teaching poetry can make individuals more aware of and responsive to climate change. The book includes essays that offer practical and theoretical insights, making it useful for educators. It covers diverse global perspectives, including Indigenous responses to climate change, climate migration, and the impact of colonialism, racism, and sexism on the environment. By integrating poetry into discussions about these topics, the authors provide creative tools and approaches for teaching about sustainability and development. This book is particularly valuable for educators in the humanities who want to inspire empathy and empowerment in their students.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This book demonstrates how humans can become sensitized to, and intervene in, environmental degradation by writing, reading, analyzing, and teaching poetry. It offers both theoretical and practice-based essays, providing a diversity of approaches and voices that will be useful in the classroom and beyond. The chapters in this edited collection explore how poetry can make readers climate-ready and climate-responsive through creativity, empathy, and empowerment. The book encompasses work from or about Oceania, Africa, Europe, North America, Asia, and Antarctica, integrating poetry into discussions of specific local and global issues, including the value of Indigenous responses to climate change; the dynamics of climate migration; the shifting boundaries between the human and more-than-human world; the ecopoetics of the prison-industrial complex; and the ongoing environmental effects of colonialism, racism, and sexism. With numerous examples of how poetry reading, teaching, and learning can enhance or modify mindsets, the book focuses on offering creative, practical approaches and tools that educators can implement into their teaching and equipping them with the theoretical knowledge to support these. This volume will appeal to educational professionals engaged in teaching environmental, sustainability, and development topics, particularly from a humanities-led perspective.
