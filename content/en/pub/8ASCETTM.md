    <h1>About</h1>
    Hestad and Aukrust conducted a review on the impact of HIV on brain health over time. They explain that conditions for people living with HIV have improved significantly since the introduction of combined anti-viral treatment (cART) in 1996. Despite this progress, cognitive issues still persist among HIV patients. The immune system does not fully recover, leading to ongoing inflammation in the body and brain. This chronic inflammation increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers. Additionally, HIV can remain hidden in the brain, and patients in low-income countries often face other health challenges like tuberculosis. The authors highlight the need for continued attention to neurocognitive and brain-related changes in HIV patients, even with advanced treatments.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In this narrative review, we look at the historical background of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and neurocognitive impairment. The conditions for the those living with HIV are completely different today than they werw 30-40 years ago. Back then, there was far more frequent and greater damage to the brain because of virus infection, In 1996, combined anti-viral treatment (cART) against HIV infection started, whitch has gradually become a succsess story. Nevertheless, cognitive impairment is still seen in people living with HIV. Even with cART the immune system does not completely normalize, among other things, there are still moderately redused number of CD4+T cells in subgroups. In most cases, there is not full normalization of the low-grade and persistent inflammation in the body and brain. The chronic inflammation predisposes to illnesses such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, and we see a somewhat increased incidence of both heart attack and stroke, and non-AIDS related cancer despite cART. It may also be significant that many patients in low-income countries have comorbid conditions such as tuberculosis. Even with cART, the virus can still lie latent and protected in certain areas, such as the brain. In addition, an increased incidence of commorbid conditions that can affect the brain (e.g. cardiovascular and metabolic diseases) is also seen. In this article, we review both neurocognitive and neuropathological changes as they occur in HIV today.
