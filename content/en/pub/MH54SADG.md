    <h1>About</h1>
    Böhner et al. developed a semi-automatic system to handle the large number of images collected by camera traps used for monitoring small mammals. Camera traps are useful for studying wildlife, but sorting through the images can be overwhelming. The authors created a workflow in the programming language R that helps manage, classify, and check the quality of these images. This system can also be updated with new images to improve its accuracy over time. By using this method, researchers can save time and ensure better data quality for ecological studies. This approach was tested in an Arctic small mammal community, showing that retraining the model with new images significantly reduces the time needed for manual image review. The authors provided the R scripts to help other ecologists use this workflow.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Camera traps have become popular for monitoring biodiversity, but the huge amounts of image data that arise 
from camera trap monitoring represent a challenge and artificial intelligence is increasingly used to automatically classify large image data sets. However, it is still challenging to combine automatic classification with other 
steps and tools needed for efficient, quality-assured and adaptive processing of camera trap images in long-term 
monitoring programs. Here we propose a semi-automatic workflow to process images from small mammal 
cameras that combines all necessary steps from downloading camera trap images in the field to a quality checked 
data set ready to be used in ecological analyses. The workflow is implemented in R and includes (1) managing 
raw images, (2) automatic image classification, (3) quality check of automatic image labels, as well as the 
possibilities to (4) retrain the model with new images and to (5) manually review subsets of images to correct 
image labels. We illustrate the application of this workflow for the development of a new monitoring program of 
an Arctic small mammal community. We first trained a classification model for the specific small mammal 
community based on images from an initial set of camera traps. As the monitoring program evolved, the classification model was retrained with a small subset of images from new camera traps. This case study highlights 
the importance of model retraining in adaptive monitoring programs based on camera traps as this step in the 
workflow increases model performance and substantially decreases the total time needed for manually reviewing 
images and correcting image labels. We provide all R scripts to make the workflow accessible to other ecologists.
