    <h1>About</h1>
    Hanscom et al. conducted a study on Merriam’s kangaroo rats, small mammals that play a crucial role in their ecosystems. They used tiny accelerometers and radiotelemetry to track the rats' movements and behaviors, which are hard to observe due to their nocturnal and secretive nature. The study found that these kangaroo rats are active only at night, especially during late-night and early morning hours. Contrary to expectations, moonlight does not reduce their activity; they are more active during moonlit nights. Additionally, the rats forage more on humid nights, likely to prevent water loss. This research provides a new way to study small nocturnal animals and highlights the importance of kangaroo rats in maintaining ecosystem balance.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    BackgroundKangaroo rats are small mammals that are among the most abundant vertebrates in many terrestrial ecosystems in Western North America and are considered both keystone species and ecosystem engineers, providing numerous linkages between other species as both consumers and resources. However, there are challenges to studying the behavior and activity of these species due to the difficulty of observing large numbers of individuals that are small, secretive, and nocturnal. Our goal was to develop an integrated approach of miniaturized animal-borne accelerometry and radiotelemetry to classify the cryptic behavior and activity cycles of kangaroo rats and test hypotheses of how their behavior is influenced by light cycles, moonlight, and weather.MethodsWe provide a proof-of-concept approach to effectively quantify behavioral patterns of small bodied ( 50 g), nocturnal, and terrestrial free-ranging mammals using large acceleration datasets by combining low-mass, miniaturized animal-borne accelerometers with radiotelemetry and advanced machine learning techniques. We developed a method of attachment and retrieval for deploying accelerometers, a non-disruptive method of gathering observational validation datasets for acceleration data on free-ranging nocturnal small mammals, and used these techniques on Merriam’s kangaroo rats to analyze how behavioral patterns relate to abiotic factors.ResultsWe found that Merriam’s kangaroo rats are only active during the nighttime phases of the diel cycle and are particularly active during later light phases of the night (i.e., late night, morning twilight, and dawn). We found no reduction in activity or foraging associated with moonlight, indicating that kangaroo rats are actually more lunarphilic than lunarphobic. We also found that kangaroo rats increased foraging effort on more humid nights, most likely as a mechanism to avoid cutaneous water loss.ConclusionsSmall mammals are often integral to ecosystem functionality, as many of these species are highly abundant ecosystem engineers driving linkages in energy flow and nutrient transfer across trophic levels. Our work represents the first continuous detailed quantitative description of fine-scale behavioral activity budgets in kangaroo rats, and lays out a general framework for how to use miniaturized biologging devices on small and nocturnal mammals to examine behavioral responses to environmental factors.
