    <h1>About</h1>
    Dawson et al. conducted a study to understand what influences the Australian public's acceptance of using lethal methods to control kangaroo populations. They surveyed 1,293 people and found that reasons for lethal control mattered: it was more acceptable for protecting agriculture, biodiversity, and animal welfare than for human consumption or safety. People who valued wildlife for human benefits were more accepting of lethal control, while those who valued wildlife for its own sake were less accepting. Knowledge about kangaroos also increased acceptance. Providing information didn't change opinions much, except slightly for human use reasons. Overall, the study suggests that while opinions vary, many Australians are open to different perspectives on wildlife management.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Wildlife management actions are increasingly contingent on acceptance by the broader public. Consequently, 
understanding factors that influence acceptability of different management options is important. In Australia, 
kangaroos (native large herbivores, Macropus spp., Osphranter spp.) are managed using lethal control for a range 
of context-specific reasons. We surveyed 1293 members of the Australian public to test whether acceptability of 
lethal control of kangaroos depends on the reason for the control, values towards wildlife (assessed using the 
Wildlife Values Orientation questionnaire), and knowledge about kangaroos. We also tested whether acceptability 
could be shifted by providing relevant information. Lethal control of kangaroos for biocentric reasons (i. 
e., agricultural protection, biodiversity conservation, animal welfare) was more acceptable than lethal control of 
kangaroos for anthropocentric reasons (i.e., human consumption, human safety). Acceptability was greater 
among survey respondents high on the domination orientation (i.e., valuing wildlife for human benefits), and 
lower among those high on the mutualism orientation (i.e., valuing wildlife for its own intrinsic value). 
Acceptability was also positively associated with knowledge of kangaroo ecology and management. Provision of 
information did not impact acceptability of lethal control for any reason except for human use, which, while not 
significant, showed promise that acceptability of lethal control for this reason could be influential to the public. 
Additionally, while the acceptability of lethal control varied widely among the Australian population, there was 
little evidence of polarisation, suggesting that large sectors of the public may be amenable to different 
perspectives.Wildlife management actions are increasingly contingent on acceptance by the broader public. Consequently,
