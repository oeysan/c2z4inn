    <h1>About</h1>
    Søvik et al. conducted a study on grassroots youth football coaches in Norway to understand their views on a one-day coach education workshop. They surveyed 113 coaches and interviewed 12 of them. The coaches generally liked the workshop content and found it easy to use. However, many did not fully apply the workshop principles in their coaching. The study identified several barriers, including lack of follow-up, limited time, and insufficient support from club officials. These findings suggest that better organizational support, especially from club officials, is crucial for successfully implementing coach education programs. The authors recommend focusing on these support systems to improve the effectiveness of future workshops for youth coaches.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This study explores grassroots coaches’ (GCs’) perceptions of the content of a one-day coach education workshop, 
the programme’s applicability, their use of the content, and the perceived barriers to implementing the 
programme in their coaching practice. One hundred and thirteen GCs completed follow-up questionnaires, 
while 12 of them were also interviewed. Descriptive statistics and qualitative analyses were conducted. The 
quantitative results indicate that the GCs were mainly positive about the programme content and found it easy 
to apply and adapt to. However, few GCs seemed to apply the programme principles to a great extent. The 
qualitative results illustrate that the GCs reported barriers that seem to relate to programme characteristics, in 
particular a lack of follow-up; individual factors, such as a lack of time; and organizational factors, like the 
lack of a shared understanding of the programme with their co-coaches, and lack of support from club officials. 
Thus, the findings imply that there is a need for an extended focus on organisational factors, especially support 
by club officials, when implementing coach education content in youth sports. Future recommendations 
for implementation of coach education workshops for youth grassroots coaches have been suggested, where 
support for the coaches is a key issue.
