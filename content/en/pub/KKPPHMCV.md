    <h1>About</h1>
    Bjertnæs et al. conducted a study to see if breastfeeding practices were linked to body mass index (BMI) and the risk of being overweight or obese in 8-year-old children. They collected data from parents about breastfeeding and lifestyle factors, and public health nurses measured the children's height and weight. After analyzing the information, they found that whether a child was breastfed or the duration of breastfeeding did not significantly affect the child's BMI or the likelihood of being overweight or obese. This research challenges the common belief that breastfeeding can help prevent childhood obesity, suggesting that other factors might be more important in determining a child's weight.

    Abstract 
Aim: The aim was to examine if breastfeeding practices were associated with body 
mass index (BMI) and risk of overweight or obesity in third grade (8 years) of elementary 
school. 
Methods: In a regional cohort, we related BMI z‐scores and presence of overweight 
or obesity at 8 years of age with ever being breastfed and with duration of exclusive 
and partial breastfeeding after adjusting for potential confounders. Parents completed 
questionnaires on breastfeeding and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors 
at school entry, and public health nurses measured height and weight. For non‐participants, 
the nurses anonymously reported these measurements together with sex 
and age. 
Results: 90% of participants had been breastfed. In adjusted analyses, BMI z‐scores 
were not significantly related to whether or not the child had been breastfed (P = .64), 
or to the duration of exclusive (P = .80) or partial breastfeeding (P = .94). Logistic regression 
also showed no significant association between breastfeeding measures and 
overweight or obesity. 
Conclusion: This study on 8‐year‐old Norwegian children did not support a commonly 
held notion that breastfeeding reduces the risk of overweight or obesity.
