    <h1>About</h1>
    Støen et al. examined brown bear attacks in Scandinavia from 1977 to 2016, focusing on how the growing bear population affected human injuries and fatalities. They found 42 incidents resulting in 42 injuries and 2 deaths. Most victims were adult men, particularly hunters, who often encountered bears after shooting at them. Nonhunters, including forestry workers and outdoor enthusiasts, were also at risk, especially from female bears with cubs. The study suggests that the increase in bear population size is linked to more attacks, particularly on hunters. To improve safety, the authors recommend better education for hunters and caution for outdoor workers and recreationists, such as avoiding dense vegetation and making noise to alert bears of their presence.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Human persecution and habitat loss have endangered large carnivore populations worldwide, 
but some are recovering, exacerbating old conflicts. Carnivores can injure and kill people; 
the most dramatic form of wildlife-human conflict. In Scandinavia, the brown bear 
(Ursus arctos) population increased from ~500 bears in 1977 to ~3300 in 2008, with an 
increase in injuries, fatalities, and public fear of bear attacks. We reviewed media coverage 
and interviewed victims to explore how bear population trends, hunter education, and other 
factors may have influenced the number of injuries and fatalities in Scandinavia from 1977 
to 2016. We found 42 incidents with 42 injuries and 2 fatalities; 42 were adult men, one was 
an adult woman conducting forestry work, and one was a boy skiing off-piste. Thirty-three 
adult men were hunting bears, moose, or small game, often with a hunting dog, and 26 had 
shot at the bear at 8±11 m before injury. Eleven nonhunters were conducting forestry work, 
inspecting a hunting area, picking berries, tending livestock, hiking, harassing a denned 
bear, and one person was killed outside his house at night. Eight of the 11 incidents of nonhunters 
involved female bears with cubs; three of these family groups were in dens and two 
were on carcasses. The annual number of hunters injured/killed was mostly influenced by 
the increase in the bear population size. The pattern was similar regarding injuries/fatalities 
to other outdoor users, but the relation with the bear population size was weaker than for 
hunters, and the null model was equally supported. Bear physiology at denning may make 
encounters with bears more risky in the fall, when bears show prehibernation behavior. 
Awareness and education efforts, especially among hunters, seem important to Ensure human safety. Recreationists and forestry workers should avoid dense vegetation or make 
noise to warn bears of their presence.
