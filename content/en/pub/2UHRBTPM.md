    <h1>About</h1>
    Cohen et al. conducted a study to improve guidelines for preventing infections from central lines, which are tubes inserted into veins for medical treatment. They found that while existing guidelines help reduce infections, they are not always followed well in practice. Using a method called "Positive Deviance," which looks for successful behaviors within a community, the authors worked with doctors to discover new, effective ways to keep the insertion process sterile and safe. These creative solutions were not included in the original guidelines but proved helpful in real-world settings. This research matters because it can lead to better adherence to safety practices, ultimately reducing infection rates and improving patient care.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Despite a proven association between the implementation of prevention guidelines for central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) and reduction in CLABSI rates, in practice there is poor adherence. Furthermore, current guidelines fail to address the multiple process on the care continuum. This research is based on the bottom-up "Positive Deviance" (PD) approach, through which multiple creative and safer solutions for central line (CL) insertion were identified that were not previously described in the guidelines. The aim of the study was to deconstruct CLABSI prevention guidelines ("during insertion" process only) through the PD approach, working with physicians to identify additional actions that, in practice, help maintain a sterile environment and contribute to patient safety.
