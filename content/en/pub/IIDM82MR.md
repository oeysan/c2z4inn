    <h1>About</h1>
    Benediktsson conducted a study on how teacher educators in Denmark try to improve their students' cultural competence, which is the ability to understand and interact effectively with people from different cultures. They found that educators face challenges because politicians and policymakers don't fully recognize the importance of multicultural education. This lack of support makes it hard for educators to teach students deeply about different cultures and critical perspectives. The educators suggest that a more comprehensive approach is needed, including changes in the education system and a shift in attitudes towards multiculturalism. The study highlights the need for institutions to take responsibility and invest in training future teachers to handle diverse classrooms effectively.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This paper explores teacher educators’ endeavours to enhance their students’ cultural competence in the context of Danish teacher education. It analyses how these endeavours resonate with the theoretical principles of critical multiculturalism and multicultural education. The study employed dyadic interviews as its primary method for data collection. The findings revealed that the educators felt constrained by the lack of awareness among politicians and policymakers of the significance of multicultural education, which made it difficult for them to develop in-depth knowledge and critical views on culture among students. The educators emphasized a need for a holistic approach that encompasses systemic changes and a shift in mindset toward critical multiculturalism in teacher education. This study calls for more institutional accountability to invest in preparing future teachers to work in multicultural classrooms.
