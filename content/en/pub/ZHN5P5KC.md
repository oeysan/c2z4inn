    <h1>About</h1>
    Happell et al. conducted a study to understand nursing students' views on improving mental health education that includes input from individuals with lived experience. They used focus groups with students who had completed a mental health module co-created by these experts and nurse educators. The students highlighted two main areas for improvement: better structuring of the module and changes to its content and approach. Some suggestions could directly enhance the module, while others emphasized the need to better prepare students to appreciate the value of lived experience. These insights are crucial for refining future mental health education programs, ensuring they effectively integrate real-world experiences alongside traditional teaching methods.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Expert by experience involvement in mental health education for health professional programmes has increased in recent decades. The related literature has articulated the benefits, and changes in attitudes have been measured in some studies. Less attention has been devoted to ways this learning approach could be improved. The aim of this paper is to present the nursing students perspectives on how Expert by Experience input into nursing curricula could be enhanced. Qualitative exploratory research was undertaken, involving focus groups with students who had completed a mental health learning module co-produced by Experts by Experience and nurse academics. Results show two main themes: getting the structure right, and changes to content and approach. Some student responses could directly influence changes to the learning module. In other instances, responses indicate the need to better prepare students of the value of lived experience knowledge in its own right, rather than adjunct to more traditional methods of education. These findings are important in encouraging reflection on how future learning modules co-produced by Experts by Experience and Mental Health Nursing academics can be refined and better articulated.
