    <h1>About</h1>
    Alvinius et al. conducted a study to understand job satisfaction and organizational commitment among high-level military leaders. They interviewed 12 experienced officers, including two women, with ranks from Colonel to Brigadier General. The study found that these leaders develop a strong identification with their organization, which they continuously manage and renegotiate. This process involves maintaining the organization's image and dealing with its demanding nature. The findings led to a new theoretical model that can help in evaluating and improving job satisfaction and commitment among top military officers. This model is useful for educational purposes and can aid in the selection, retention, and development of high-level military leaders. The study's small sample size and lack of gender analysis are noted limitations.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Purpose 
It has been claimed that job satisfaction is the most important and frequently studied attitude in organizational behaviour research. However, as most studies relate to lower hierarchical levels, the purpose of this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of job satisfaction and organizational commitment among high-level managers – military leaders in this case. 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
A grounded theory approach was used. The empirical material is based on 12 interviews, two of which were with women. The informants had wide experience of a number of leadership positions as well as participation in international operations. Their ranks ranged from Colonel to Brigadier General, and they represented army and naval units, the Armed Forces Headquarters and Swedish Defence University. 
 
Findings 
The qualitative analysis resulted in a theoretical model that describes the job satisfaction of military leaders at the strategic level, which concerns establishing and balancing organizational commitment. This means that top level managers develop, manage and recreate a “sense of oneness” between themselves and the organization – a strong identification that is established, challenged, changed and renegotiated in a continuous process. Establishing and balancing organizational commitment is built on two overarching categories: keeping up the organizational image and responding to organizational greediness. 
 
Research limitations/implications 
Research limitations are as follows: small sample, lack of representativeness and lack of elaboration on possible gender-related aspects. 
 
Practical implications 
The suggested model may be valuable in educational settings when evaluating the job satisfaction and organizational commitment of high-level officers. The model may have practical implications when it comes to selection, retention and leader development of high-level military officers. 
 
Originality/value 
A new integrative, theoretical model of job satisfaction and organizational commitment of high-level officers is developed and discussed.
