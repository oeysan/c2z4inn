    <h1>About</h1>
    Marie Haabeth Brox et al. conducted a study using mice to understand how dental erosion starts and progresses when exposed to acidic drinks like cola. They found that after just two weeks, the enamel on the molars was significantly eroded, exposing the dentin, which is the layer beneath the enamel. The tooth height decreased by 35% compared to mice not exposed to cola. This erosion continued over four and six weeks, with tooth height dropping by 40% and 43%, respectively. These findings are important because they show how quickly acidic drinks can damage teeth, emphasizing the need for early prevention and intervention to protect dental health. This research helps us understand the impact of diet on dental erosion and the importance of monitoring and addressing it early.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Objective: Purpose of this research was to examine the onset, progression and wear rates of dental erosion in an established mouse model. Material and methods: Dental erosion in mice was experimentally induced, and the acidic effects of cola drink on their teeth after 2, 4 and 6-weeks were closely analysed by scanning electron microscopy. The tooth height and enamel or dentin loss were established.  Results: The dental erosion on the molars showed clear progression from 2 to 6 weeks. By the 2-week mark, a significant portion of enamel was already eroded, revealing the dentin on the lingual cusps. When adjusted for attritional wear, molars exposed to cola for 2 weeks showed a 35% drop in lingual tooth height compared to controls (533 μm vs. 818 μm). At 4 and 6 weeks, the cola-exposed group continued to display decreased lingual tooth heights by 40% (476 μm vs. 799 μm) and 43% (440 μm vs. 767 μm), respectively. Conclusion: This study revealed significant acidic effects of cola drink on mouse molars as early as 2 weeks. These findings highlight the challenge of monitoring dental erosion clinically and underscore the importance of early preventive and intervention measures.
