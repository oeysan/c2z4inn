    <h1>About</h1>
    Fattash et al. studied how certain genes in strawberries respond to cold temperatures, which is important for developing cold-tolerant strawberry varieties. They looked at the activity of eight specific genes in three types of strawberries with different levels of cold tolerance. They found that one gene, FvCBF1E, was more active in cold conditions than another similar gene, FvCBF1B.1, across all strawberry types. Another gene, FvADH, showed high activity in both leaf and crown tissues, especially in the most cold-tolerant type, 'ALTA'. They also observed that changes in gene activity often happened before changes in protein levels. This research helps in understanding how strawberries can be bred to better withstand cold weather, which is useful for farmers and gardeners.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Identifying and characterizing cold responsive genes in Fragaria vesca associated with or responsible for low temperature tolerance is a vital part of strawberry cultivar development. In this study we have investigated the transcript levels of eight genes, two dehydrin genes, three putative ABA-regulated genes, two cold–inducible CBF genes and the alcohol dehydrogenase gene, extracted from leaf and crown tissues of three F. vesca genotypes that vary in cold tolerance. Transcript levels of the CBF/DREB1 transcription factor FvCBF1E exhibited stronger cold up-regulation in comparison to FvCBF1B.1 in all genotypes. Transcripts of FvADH were highly up-regulated in both crown and leaf tissues from all three genotypes. In the ‘ALTA’ genotype, FvADH transcripts were significantly higher in leaf than crown tissues and more than 10 to 20-fold greater than in the less cold-tolerant ‘NCGR1363’ and ‘FDP817’ genotypes. FvGEM, containing the conserved ABRE promoter element, transcript was found to be cold-regulated in crowns. Direct comparison of the kinetics of transcript and protein accumulation of dehydrins was scrutinized. In all genotypes and organs, the changes of XERO2 transcript levels generally preceded protein changes, while levels of COR47 protein accumulation preceded the increases in COR47 RNA in ‘ALTA’ crowns.
