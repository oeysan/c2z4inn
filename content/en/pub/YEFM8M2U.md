    <h1>About</h1>
    Øfsti examines how Norwegian distribution companies adapted to the closure and reopening of cinemas during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. They found that local video-on-demand (VOD) services in Norway and Scandinavia responded differently compared to international services. Despite employing various strategies to cope with the sudden changes, none of the companies were able to fully recover the financial losses caused by the absence of regular cinema screenings. This study highlights the challenges faced by the film industry during the pandemic and underscores the difficulty of compensating for lost revenue through alternative distribution methods. Understanding these responses is important for future planning in the event of similar disruptions.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This article examines the choices made by Norwegian distribution companies during three key phases of cinema lockdown and reopening in 2020. Though the article mainly aims to chronicle this particular moment in time I find that Norwegian and Scandinavian VOD-services acted differently than international services and that, while distributor companies used several different strategies in the face of sudden change, no one was close to recouping the losses from the lack of ordinary cinematic exhibition.
