    <h1>About</h1>
    Uddin et al. conducted a study to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affected stock markets in Asian countries and their connection to global financial markets. They found that during the pandemic, these markets showed a strong positive dependence, meaning they moved together more closely than before. This increased co-movement was especially noticeable over longer periods. These findings are important for people involved in the stock market, such as investors and policymakers, because they highlight how global events like the pandemic can cause markets to behave similarly, which can impact investment decisions and economic policies. The study was published in the International Review of Economics and Finance.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The purpose of this paper is to examine the connected dynamics of the affected Asian financial 
markets and global financial market in relation to the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) 
pandemic. We particularly examine the temporal dependence and connectedness of the affected 
markets with the global financial market by using the time-varying dependence approach in a 
time-frequency space under COVID-19. Our findings indicate a strong, positive dependence 
among the investigated markets’ due to the outbreak of COVID-19. In addition, we report an 
increased tendency of co-movements over the higher horizon which is documented by COVID-19. 
These findings are of significant interest for market participants, policymakers, and international 
investors.
