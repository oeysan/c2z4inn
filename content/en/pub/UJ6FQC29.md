    <h1>About</h1>
    Tiscareno-Osorno et al. conducted a systematic review to evaluate the quality of studies that use scales to measure how connected people feel to nature. They analyzed 35 studies published between 2000 and 2021 and found that only five of them were of high or adequate quality. The authors suggest several improvements: creating a universal way to measure nature connectedness, enhancing the quality of these measurement tools, distinguishing whether the scales measure long-term traits or temporary states, validating the scales across different cultures, and developing scales suitable for children and teenagers. These recommendations aim to improve how we understand and measure people's relationship with nature, which can help in promoting environmental awareness and well-being.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This systematic review assesses the methodological quality of manuscripts focusing on scales that explicitly measure nature connectedness. A literature search in six electronic databases was conducted using a search strategy based on PICO guidelines. Only peer-reviewed primary research available in English language, published between 2000 and 2021, meeting the scope of this review were included. Data from 35 studies were narratively analyzed. Their methodological quality was assessed using the COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist. Only five studies were rated as high/adequate quality. Based on the findings we make the following recommendations: (a) the need for the development of a more universal nature connectedness construct, (b) the requirement to increase the methodological quality of the scales, (c) the need to identify which the scales measure trait or state, (d) the need to increase the validate scales cross-culturally, and (e) the need to develop scales that can be employed with non-adult samples.
