    <h1>About</h1>
    Knox et al. conducted a study on improving the cognitive performance of military cyber cadets at the Norwegian Defence Cyber Academy. They explored "Slow Education," a teaching method that emphasizes thoughtful reflection and self-regulation, to enhance high-order thinking skills necessary for managing cyberpower. Over three years, 37 cadets participated in this educational approach, which was evaluated during a two-week Cyber Defence Exercise. The study found that techniques like reflective pondering and metacognition (thinking about one's own thinking) can boost cognitive agility, which is crucial for effective cyber defense. These findings are important because they offer new ways to assess and improve human performance in cyber operations, helping military personnel better manage complex cyber challenges.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Governance of cyberpower from a military perspective are focused on the efforts to control and influence events occurring in cyberspace. For the Norwegian Defence, this means educating cyber engineers, responsible for governing cyberpower effects, beyond technical skills and competencies. To match the complexity of modern warfighting necessitates adaptive high-order thinking skills. Building on earlier cognitive engineering and human factors research in cyber defence this article suggests how Slow Education has the potential to improve cognitive performance among cyber cadets. Slow techniques were applied to 37 cyber cadets during a three-year bachelor programme at the Norwegian Defence Cyber Academy. The quantitative data for this study was gathered during a two-week Cyber Defence Exercise. Combining and applying a novel pedagogic method with psychological techniques suggests reflective pondering, self-regulation and metacognition as being associated with cognitive agility. This study helps develop and make metrics available that are suitable to evaluate human performance in cyber defence.
