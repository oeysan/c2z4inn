    <h1>About</h1>
    Boe et al. conducted a study on a leadership development program at Sykehuspartner HF, a health organization in Norway. They surveyed 89 participants to understand the program's effectiveness. The findings showed that the program successfully helped participants, the organization, and customers by enhancing understanding of strategic goals, change management, and communication. Participants who lead employees reported greater benefits compared to those who lead managers. This suggests that leadership training can significantly improve strategic thinking and communication skills, especially for those directly managing employees. These insights are important for organizations aiming to improve leadership and operational efficiency through targeted development programs.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Sykehuspartner HF is a central contributor both to the development of new solutions and the implementation of prioritized programs and projects in Health South-East region in Norway. Sykehuspartner HF has introduced a leadership development program for its own leaders. The research unit in this study was limited to Sykehuspartner HF's leadership program as it was carried out in 2021/2022. In order to shed light on the issue of the participants' perceived benefit from participating in the leadership development program and the extent to which the program has succeeded in achieving its purpose, an online questionnaire was used as the data collection method. The questionnaire was sent to all participants after completion of the leadership development program. 89 participants in the program filled out the questionnaire. The first overarching research question that was asked in this study was: To what extent does the program succeed in achieving the desired effect for the participants, the organization and the customer? A second research question was: Is there a difference in perceived benefit dependent upon whether the participants leads managers or leads employees? The results revealed that the program had good effects related to achieving the desired effect for the participants, the organization and the customer. This was revealed as a deeper understanding of the strategic road map and the strategic goals, change management, transformation within the company, changes in communication and messages related to change. However, these perceived benefits of the program was higher in the group of participants who lead employees compared to those participants who lead managers.
