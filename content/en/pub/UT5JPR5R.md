    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    1 Introduction Embedding lived experience in mental health nursing education is increasing, with research findings suggesting the impact is positive. To date, research has primarily targeted the perspectives of nursing students and academics from the health professions. 4.2 Aim To enhance understanding of the unique knowledge and expertise experts by experience contribute to mental health nursing education. 4.3 Methods Qualitative exploratory research methods were employed. In-depth individual interviews were conducted with experts by experience who delivered a coproduced learning module to nursing students in Europe and Australia. 4.4 Results Participants described their unique and essential contribution to mental health nursing education under four main themes: critical thinking, beyond textbooks; interactive and open communication; understanding personal recovery; and mental health is health. 4.5 Conclusions These findings present an understanding of the unique knowledge and expertise Experts by Experience contribute to mental health education not previously addressed in the literature. Appreciating and respecting this, unique contribute is necessary as Expert by Experience contributions continue to develop. 4.6 Implications for Practice Mental health services purport to value service user involvement. Identifying and respecting and valuing the unique contribution they bring to services is essential. Without this understanding, tokenistic involvement may become a major barrier.
