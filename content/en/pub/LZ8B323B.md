    <h1>About</h1>
    Happell et al. conducted a study to understand nursing students' attitudes towards people diagnosed with mental illness and their views on consumer participation in mental health services. They surveyed nursing students from Australia and Western Europe using two questionnaires. The study found that students who believed mental health nursing positively impacts patients and had fewer negative stereotypes about mental illness were more likely to support consumer participation, which means involving patients in their own care and decision-making. This is important because positive attitudes can lead to better mental health care and more inclusive practices. The research also confirmed that the tools used to measure these attitudes were reliable.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background 
Understanding student attitudes towards people diagnosed with mental illness is central to realising evidence-based nursing education and policy at an international level. Redressing stigmatised views can assist in preparing nursing students to work in mental health settings and support the active involvement of consumers in all aspects of mental health service delivery (known as: consumer participation) at individual and systemic levels. Accurate research on nursing student attitudes is dependent on the availability of valid and reliable measures. 
 
Objectives 
Using data from and international study, this research sought to: (1) evaluate two measures of nurse student attitudes, and (2) explore whether attitudes to people labelled with a diagnosis of mental illness and who use mental health services is associated with more positive attitudes to consumer participation in mental health services. 
 
Design 
Self-report quantitative data gained via the Consumer Participation Questionnaire (CPQ) and Mental Health Nurse Education Survey (MHNES). 
 
Setting and participants 
University nursing students in Australia and Western Europe. 
 
Data 
Pooled CPQ and MHNES data from Australia, Ireland, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands. 
 
Methods 
The MHNES and CPQ were evaluated via exploratory factor analysis and Rasch modelling. Hierarchical regression was applied to see whether attitudes to mental illness and mental health practice relate to attitudes to consumer participation after addressing demographic differences. 
 
Results 
Refined MHNES scales demonstrated overall fit on Rasch models. Reliabilities for MHNES ranged from 0.82 to 0.73. Perceived value of mental health nursing to consumers and lower negative stereotypes were associated with positive attitudes to consumer participation independent of age, gender and country [F (9, 381) = 15.78, p < .001]. Students who considered mental health nursing made a valuable contribution represented the strongest association with a positive attitude towards consumer participation. 
 
Conclusions 
Differences in openness to consumer participation are partly attributable to views about people diagnosed with mental illness and the perception that mental health practice makes a positive difference to these people within health service contexts.
