    <h1>About</h1>
    Larsson and Alvinius conducted a study to understand what makes university professors satisfied with their jobs. They interviewed 12 professors from various academic fields in Sweden. They found that job satisfaction comes from five main areas: the impact on society and the scientific community, social interactions at work, personal achievements and pride, daily positive experiences, and formal conditions like salary and retirement options. They created a model showing how these factors interact to influence job satisfaction. Although the study had a small sample size, it highlights the importance of giving professors autonomy in their work. This insight is valuable for universities aiming to improve their professors' work environment and overall satisfaction.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Purpose 
The purpose of this paper is to model factors that contribute to job satisfaction among university professors. 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
The approach was qualitative; 12 in-depth interviews were conducted with Swedish university full professors representing 11 different academic subjects. 
 
Findings 
Five facets of job satisfaction were identified: distal environment (e.g. impact on society and the scientific community), proximal social environment, self (e.g. receiving external credit and experiencing internal pride), the uplifts of daily life and formal conditions (e.g. pay and opportunities to continue after retirement). A model was inductively developed according to which professors’ job satisfaction is influenced by interacting contextual and individual antecedent conditions. 
 
Research limitations/implications 
Because a qualitative approach was used, with a limited number of informants, there is a lack of representativeness and the concepts generated are of a sensitizing rather than a definitive character. 
 
Practical implications 
Attention should be paid to university professors’ need for autonomy, otherwise public management control strivings may become counter-productive. 
 
Originality/value 
A new model of professors’ job satisfaction with a richness of details was developed.
