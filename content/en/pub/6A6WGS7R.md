    <h1>About</h1>
    Bramness et al. conducted a study to understand how people's self-rated effects of alcohol relate to their blood alcohol concentration (BAC). They worked with 20 young adult male volunteers who had experience with binge drinking but did not have alcohol use disorders. Participants filled out a questionnaire about their subjective response to alcohol and then consumed a fixed amount of alcohol based on their body weight. The researchers found that those who reported feeling the effects of alcohol with fewer drinks (low SRE-score) had higher BACs throughout the 12-hour period, especially in the first 2 hours. This suggests that people who need more alcohol to feel its effects may have a lower BAC due to faster presystemic metabolism, which is how the body processes alcohol before it enters the bloodstream.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Aims: A high number of alcohol units required to feel a subjective effect of alcohol predicts future alcohol use disorders (AUDs). The subjective 
response to alcohol can be measured using the validated retrospective self-rated effects of alcohol (SRE) questionnaire. Few studies have 
investigated the specific relationship between SRE and blood alcohol concentration (BAC) in an experimental setting. 
Methods: Twenty healthy young adult male volunteers who had experience with binge drinking, but did not have AUD, filled out the SREquestionnaire and were served with a fixed amount of alcohol per body weight. BACs were measured throughout a 12-hour period, reaching a 
maximum BAC of ∼0.13%. Median split of SRE-scores was utilized to compare BACs among participants with relatively high effects (low SRE) 
and relatively low effects (high SRE) of alcohol. 
Results: Participants reporting a relatively low SRE-score had a statistically significant higher measured BAC at all time points until alcohol 
was eliminated. This was especially pronounced during the first 2 hours after alcohol (P = 0.015) without a significant difference in the alcohol 
elimination rate being detected. 
Conclusion: The study indicates that a self-ated SRE-score is related to BACs after the ingestion of a standardized amount of alcohol per body 
weight. Reporting a higher number of alcohol units before feeling an effect was related to a lower BAC. As the differences in BAC between 
relatively high and low self-rated effects appeared rapidly after intake, this could be interpreted as an effect of presystemic metabolism of 
alcohol.
