    <h1>About</h1>
    Kleppe's book examines the importance of teaching poetry and its benefits throughout a person's life. They highlight how poetry enhances literacy, creativity, personal growth, emotional intelligence, analytical thinking, and social skills. These abilities are essential in today's education systems. Despite this, the focus on STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and math) has led to poetry being undervalued in schools. The authors argue that poetry is not just an extra but a vital tool for stimulating rich linguistic experiences and cognitive challenges. Learning through poetry helps students make unique connections and serves as a reflective tool for lifelong learning. This book is useful for teachers, students, and scholars interested in integrating poetry into education to improve literacy and interdisciplinary learning.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This book explores poetry and pedagogy in practice across the lifespan. Poetry is directly linked to improved literacy, creativity, personal development, emotional intelligence, complex analytical thinking and social interaction: all skills that are crucial in contemporary educational systems. However, a narrow focus on STEM subjects at the expense of the humanities has led educators to deprioritize poetry and to overlook its interdisciplinary, multi-modal potential. The editors and contributors argue that poetry is not a luxury, but a way to stimulate linguistic experiences that are formally rich and cognitively challenging. To learn through poetry is not just to access information differently, but also to forge new and different connections that can serve as reflective tools for lifelong learning. This interdisciplinary book will be of value to teachers and students of poetry, as well as scholars interested in literacy across the disciplines.
