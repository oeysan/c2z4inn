    <h1>About</h1>
    Chrisman & Chrisman explore the shift towards a circular bioeconomy, which focuses on using renewable biological resources instead of carbon-based materials. This transition is important for achieving climate and economic goals. They identify five key factors driving this change, such as the need for sustainable materials and innovative technologies. However, challenges like lengthy development and commercialization processes can slow progress. To address these issues, the authors suggest forming organizational clusters—groups of companies and institutions located near each other—to improve resource efficiency and facilitate knowledge sharing. This approach can help speed up the development of new biotechnologies, making them more accessible and effective in reducing environmental impact.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    There is growing interest from governmental organizations and firms in the biotechnology sector in transitioning to a circular bioeconomy to meet their climate and economic goals. We use data from a recent presentation given at the CPAC Rome Workshop 2023 (30, 31) to present five key factors driving the transition away from carbon-based materials to biobased ones and the technologies that are being implemented to achieve this. We address some of the new challenges that have arisen such as long wait times at the process development and commercialization stages. Finally, we offer solutions through the implementation of organizational clusters to overcome the challenge of resource efficiency through geographical proximity, and knowledge transfer.
