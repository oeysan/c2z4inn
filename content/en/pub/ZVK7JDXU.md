    <h1>About</h1>
    Snipstad and Vik examined user-controlled personal assistance (UPA) for children with disabilities in Norway. UPA aims to give children independence and control, based on the independent living (IL) ideology. However, since minors need an adult to manage their UPA, parents often juggle caregiving and administrative roles. The study, using a qualitative approach, found that the current framework might not fully align with the realities of childhood. Instead of achieving complete user control now, UPA could be seen as a tool to help children gradually gain independence. This suggests a need to adjust the ideological principles to better fit the practical needs of families and children. This research highlights the importance of balancing independence with appropriate support for young people with disabilities.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In Norway, user-controlled personal assistance (UPA) is a right for children under the age of 18. Based on the independent living (IL) ideology, the intention of UPA is to provide the person with user control, independence and more. However, in order to receive UPA, minors need an external actor to be formally in charge. Through a qualitative approach, this article discusses whether the ideological principles governing UPA can be utilised as intended in families where the parent is expected both to care for and protect the child as well as act as an administrator providing opportunities for the child to enjoy the IL principles. The findings in this article suggest that there may be a need to revise the ideological framework in order to better encompass the reality of childhood. Instead of full user control at present, UPA could be a viewed as an empowering tool in the process towards future independence.
