    <h1>About</h1>
    Frostenson et al. examined how a master's program in organization and leadership at a Norwegian university college adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially designed for part-time distance learning with monthly in-person sessions, the program underwent significant changes during the pandemic. These changes led to a more flexible and innovative format that persisted even after the pandemic. The authors highlight how the program's evolution created new permanent opportunities, such as increased student responsibility for interaction. This study is important because it shows how educational programs can adapt to unexpected challenges and improve their structure, offering better learning experiences and flexibility for students.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The purpose of the chapter is to describe and analyse the changes of a master’s programme in organisation and leadership in a Norwegian university college before, during and after the pandemic. Already established as a programme with modules and in-callings once a month, enabling half-time distance studies, it underwent changes during the pandemic and found a partly new and more flexible shape after the pandemic had ended. The process is described as a change process which led to permanent new opportunities from a pedagogical and academic perspective. Measures taken to deal with the challenges are analysed and presented as innovative ways of developing the programme as a whole, for example opening up for permanent pedagogical solutions such as increased student responsibility for interaction.
