    <h1>About</h1>
    Larsson et al. conducted a study to explore how daily positive experiences, known as "uplifts," and coping strategies can help military personnel manage stress from everyday challenges. They interviewed 15 Swedish veterans five years after their peace enforcement mission. Using a method called grounded theory, they analyzed patterns over six time periods before, during, and after the mission. The study developed a model suggesting that combining daily uplifts with effective coping can reduce stress reactions from daily hassles. Notably, none of the veterans showed signs of PTSD or required psychological treatment, which is significant given the high stress and common mental health issues associated with such missions. This research highlights the importance of positive experiences and coping in managing stress for military personnel.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The aim of this research was to gain a deeper understanding of how daily hassles and uplifts interact with each other and with stress reactions over time in military personnel. Interviews were conducted with 15 Swedish veterans five years after an international peace enforcement mission. The grounded theory method was used and result patterns were generated for six specific time periods distributed before, during, and after the mission. A theoretical model was developed showing that everyday uplifts combined with adaptive coping can be sufficient to limit stress reactions related to daily hassles. The model was supported by the fact that, five years after the mission, none of interviewees had received a PTSD diagnosis or needed professional psychological treatment. The last-mentioned outcome is noteworthy in itself given the severe stress often encountered in peace enforcement missions and previous research observations of high PTSD incidence, suicide rates, criminality, and substance abuse in mission participants.
