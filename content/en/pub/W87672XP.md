    <h1>About</h1>
    Boson et al. conducted a study to understand how gaming affects the emotional closeness between parents and their children over time. They followed Swedish adolescents from ages 12.5 to 17 and collected data at two points, in 2013 and 2017/2018. The study found that when children felt emotionally close to their parents, they spent less time gaming as they grew older. Conversely, more time spent gaming led to less emotional closeness with mothers over time. For girls, increased gaming was specifically linked to less emotional closeness with their fathers. These findings suggest that strong parent-child relationships can help prevent excessive gaming, which might negatively impact adolescents' social and emotional development.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The aim of this study was to add knowledge of the longitudinal associations between gaming and emotional closeness between parents and their children. We hypothesized that parent–child emotional closeness was linked to less gaming activity over time and that more gaming activity was linked to less parent–child emotional closeness over time. We also tested the moderating effect of child gender on these anticipated links. This study involved a sample of Swedish adolescents, spanning the developmental years from age 12.5 to 17, and included data from two time points (T1; year 2013 and T2; years 2017/2018) with N = 782 participants (T1 Mage = 12.10, SD = 0.40; 49.6% girls). Utilizing a series of Cross-Lagged Panel Models, we found that emotional closeness to both mother and father predicted less time spent on gaming over time. More time spent on gaming predicted less emotional closeness to mother over time. Additionally, gaming activity among girls was specifically related to less emotional closeness to their father over time. Strengthening parent–child relationships and emotional bonds may be crucial in safeguarding adolescents from developing habits of excessive gaming that could potentially pose problems for their psychosocial development.
