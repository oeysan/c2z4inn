    <h1>About</h1>
    Andersson et al. conducted a study to understand how intensive care nurses perceive and practice oral care for patients, especially those who are intubated. They found that while nurses recognize oral care as an important part of their duties and have the necessary skills and equipment, they often approach it as a routine task rather than focusing on the individual needs of patients. The study suggests that nurses should shift from a task-oriented approach to a more person-centered one to better meet patients' needs. This change could improve the quality of care and ensure that patients' experiences are documented and considered. Understanding these perceptions can help improve oral care practices in intensive care settings.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Objectives 
To identify intensive care nurses’ perceptions of oral care according to Coker et al.’s (2013) conceptual framework and to contribute to the knowledge base of oral care in intensive care. 
 
Design/methods 
This was a concurrent embedded mixed-methods design, with more weight given to the quantitative part. Participants responded to the Nursing Care related to Oral Health questionnaire, including perceptions of oral care antecedents (18 items), defining attributes (17 items), and consequences (6 items) and two open-ended questions. The data were analysed with descriptive and correlation statistics and qualitative content analysis. 
 
Setting 
Intensive care nurses (n = 88) in six general intensive care units. 
 
Results 
Intensive care nurses perceived that an important part of nursing care was oral care, especially to intubated patients. They perceived that the nursing staff was competent in oral care skills and had access to different kinds of equipment and supplies to provide oral care. The oral cavity was inspected on a daily basis, mostly without the use of any assessment instruments. Oral care seemed to be task-oriented, and documentation of the patients’ experiences of the oral care process was rare. 
 
Conclusions 
The antecedents, knowledge and skills are available to provide quality oral care, but intensive care nurses seem to have difficulties translating these components into practice. Thus they might have to shift their task-oriented approach towards oral care to a more person-centred approach in order to be able to meet patients’ needs.
