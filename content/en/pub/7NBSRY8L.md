    <h1>About</h1>
    Bödeker et al. studied how ungulate browsing (when animals like deer eat tree leaves and branches) affects forest growth. They used data from the Bavarian Forest National Park collected between 2007 and 2018 to predict browsing impact. By analyzing this data, they developed a method to measure changes in browsing pressure, which can help wildlife managers decide on actions like hunting or fencing. They found that with about 1,000 observations, they could detect a change in browsing probability as small as ±5 percentage points. This method is cost-effective and can be used to manage wildlife in the park and other areas, ensuring forests grow healthily and sustainably.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Ungulate browsing has a major impact on the composition and structure of forests. 
Repeatedly conducted, large-scale regeneration inventories can monitor the extent of browsing 
pressure and its impacts on forest regeneration development. Based on the respective results, the 
necessity and extent of wildlife management activities such as hunting, fencing, etc., can be identified 
at a landscape scale. However, such inventories have rarely been integrated into wildlife management 
decision making. In this article, we evaluate a regeneration inventory method which was carried 
out in the Bavarian Forest National Park between 2007 and 2018. We predict the browsing impact by 
calculating browsing probabilities using a logistic mixed effect model. To provide wildlife managers 
with feedback on their activities, we developed a test which can assess significant changes in 
browsing probability between different inventory periods. To find the minimum observable browsing 
probability change, we simulated ungulate browsing based on the data of a potential browsing 
indicator species (Sorbus aucuparia) in the National Park. Sorbus aucuparia is evenly distributed, 
commonly found, selectively browsed and meets the ecosystem development objectives in our study 
area. We were able to verify a browsing probability change down to ±5 percentage points with 
a sample size of about 1,000 observations per inventory run. In view of the size of the National 
Park and the annual fluctuations in browsing pressure, this estimation accuracy seems sufficient. In 
seeking the maximal cost-efficiency, we were able to reduce this sample size in a sensitivity analysis 
by about two thirds without severe loss of information for wildlife management. Based on our 
findings, the presented inventory method combined with our evaluation tool has the potential to be 
a robust and efficient instrument to assess the impact of herbivores that are in the National Park and 
other regions.
