    <h1>About</h1>
    Han et al. conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the relationship between magnesium intake and the risk of developing high blood pressure (hypertension). They analyzed data from ten cohort studies involving over 180,000 participants. The authors found that higher dietary magnesium intake was linked to a lower risk of hypertension. Specifically, for every 100 mg increase in daily magnesium intake, the risk of hypertension decreased by 5%. However, the connection between magnesium levels in the blood and hypertension was less clear. This study suggests that consuming more magnesium-rich foods, like nuts and leafy greens, might help reduce the risk of high blood pressure, although more research is needed to understand the role of blood magnesium levels.

    Background 
 
The findings of prospective cohort studies are inconsistent regarding the association between dietary magnesium intake and serum magnesium concentration and the risk of hypertension. We aimed to review the evidence from prospective cohort studies and perform a dose-response meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between dietary magnesium intake and serum magnesium concentrations and the risk of hypertension. 
 
Methods 
 
We searched systematically PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library databases from October 1951 through June 2016. Prospective cohort studies reporting effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for hypertension in more than two categories of dietary magnesium intake and/or serum magnesium concentrations were included. Random-effects models were used to combine the estimated effects. 
 
Results 
 
Nine articles (six on dietary magnesium intake, two on serum magnesium concentration and one on both) of ten cohort studies, including 20,119 cases of hypertension and 180,566 participates, were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. We found an inverse association between dietary magnesium intake and the risk of hypertension [relative risk (RR) = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.98] comparing the highest intake group with the lowest. A 100 mg/day increment in magnesium intake was associated with a 5% reduction in the risk of hypertension (RR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.90, 1.00). The association of serum magnesium concentration with the risk of hypertension was marginally significant (RR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.80, 1.02). 
 
Conclusions 
 
Current evidence supports the inverse dose-response relationship between dietary magnesium intake and the risk of hypertension. However, the evidence about the relationship between serum magnesium concentration and hypertension is limited
