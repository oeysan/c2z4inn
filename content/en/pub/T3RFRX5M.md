    <h1>About</h1>
    Herstad and Sandven examined how different types of innovation affect employment growth in companies. They used data from Norwegian surveys and public records from 2004 to 2010. Their study found that when companies introduce both product and process innovations together, they are more likely to see sustained employment growth. However, if a company is downsizing, it is less likely to introduce these beneficial innovation bundles. Standalone product innovations help maintain moderate growth but don't significantly boost employment. On the other hand, standalone process innovations can lead to substantial growth after a period of moderate expansion. This research shows that innovation and employment growth are closely connected, influencing each other positively or negatively over time.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This paper considers in detail how different types of innovation (products, processes, patents, combinations) are related to different employment growth characteristics (exit or survival, with employment upscaling or downscaling at moderate or high rates). Using Norwegian Community Innovation Survey (CIS) data collected in 2008 and merged with public employer-employee registers for the years 2004-2010, it finds that growth persists over time, and increases the probability that ‘bundles’ of complementary product and process innovations are introduced that strengthen employment further. Downscaling also persists, and reduces the probability that ‘bundles’ are introduced that could turn the negative trend. While standalone product innovations follow in the wake of rapid expansion, such have limited impact on employment beyond sustaining growth at moderate levels. Standalone process innovations, by contrast, tend to be introduced after a period of moderate growth, yet, might give rise to large subsequent expansions. These results demonstrate that innovation and employment growth are multi-dimensional characteristics of the firm, which are interlinked with each other in virtuous or vicious circles that unfolds over time.
