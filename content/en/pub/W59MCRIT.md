    <h1>About</h1>
    Bocking et al. conducted an international study to explore the impact of involving individuals with lived experience of mental distress in mental health nursing education. They created a learning module co-produced by these "Experts by Experience" and mental health nurse academics. Through interviews, the study found that personal stories from Experts by Experience helped build strong connections with students and made the human aspect of mental health more visible. These insights suggest that such teaching methods can reduce stigma and improve public perceptions of mental health, potentially attracting more skilled professionals to the field. The study supports the inclusion of Experts by Experience in mental health education to foster a more humanistic and rights-based approach.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Consumer participation is a clear expectation of contemporary mental health policy. Most activity has concentrated in direct service delivery, and academic roles for mental health consumers have been slow to establish. An international project was undertaken to implement and evaluate meaningful consumer involvement in mental health nursing education. A learning module was co-produced between 'Experts by Experience' (drawing on experience of mental distress and service use) and Mental Health Nurse Academics. This qualitative exploratory study aimed to capture how Experts by Experience perceive their contribution. Interviews were undertaken with Experts by Experience who delivered the learning module. Data were analysed thematically and subsequently interpreted with Critical Social Theory. Two main themes emerged from the findings: 'there wasn't a barrier' described how personal narratives enhanced relationships between Experts by Experience and students; and 'made the human being visible', described their experiences of allowing students to see the person behind a diagnosis. These findings suggest Experts by Experience teaching is valuable and potentially a tool in redressing stigma. Addressing poor public perceptions could attract higher numbers of quality practitioners to mental health and meet identified workforce shortages. The findings presented here strengthen the evidence base for Expert by Experience roles in mental health professional education. These findings can be considered in international curricula reviews and aid progress towards a more socio-political, humanistic focus in mental health nursing, congruent with rights-based reform agendas.
