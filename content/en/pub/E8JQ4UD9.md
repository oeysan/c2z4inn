    <h1>About</h1>
    Dellsén explores how we decide if an explanation is "good enough" to believe, even if we suspect there might be a better one we haven't thought of yet. In science and daily life, we often accept the best available explanation for a set of facts. However, this paper argues that an explanation should be considered "good enough" if it has undergone "explanatory consolidation." This means that over time, as more evidence supports the explanation and attempts to find better alternatives fail, the current explanation becomes more credible. Understanding this process helps us make more confident decisions about what to believe, even when we can't be sure it's the absolute best explanation. This insight is valuable for making informed choices in both scientific research and everyday situations.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In science and everyday life, we often infer that something is true because it would explain some set of facts better than any other hypothesis we can think of. But what if we have reason to believe that there is a better way to explain these facts that we just haven’t thought of? Wouldn’t that undermine our warrant for believing the best available explanation? Many philosophers have assumed that we can solve suchunderconsideration problemsby stipulating that a hypothesis should not only be ‘the best’ explanation available; rather, it should also be ‘good enough’. Unfortunately, however, the only current suggestion for what it might mean to say that an explanation is ‘good enough’ is, well, not good enough. This paper aims to provide a better account of what is required for an explanatory hypothesis to be considered ‘good enough’. In brief, the account holds that a ‘good enough’ hypothesis is one that has gone through a process that I callexplanatory consolidation, in which accumulating evidence and failed attempts to formulate better alternatives gradually make it more plausible that the explanation we currently have is better than any other that could be formulated.
