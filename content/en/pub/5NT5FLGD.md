    <h1>About</h1>
    Chandyo et al. conducted a study on the levels of important nutrients, cobalamin (vitamin B12) and folate, in breastfed infants aged 6-11 months in Bhaktapur, Nepal. They found that 11% of the infants had a cobalamin deficiency, and 24% had low cobalamin levels. Additionally, 53% had elevated levels of total homocysteine and 75% had high methylmalonic acid, both indicators of functional cobalamin deficiency. However, none of the infants showed folate deficiency. These findings are significant because cobalamin is essential for growth and brain development, and deficiencies can have serious health consequences. Understanding the prevalence of these deficiencies can help improve infant nutrition and health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Cobalamin and folate are crucial micronutrients during infancy and they are required for growth and cognitive development. Due to the monotonous and predominantly vegetarian-based complementary feeding and poor maternal micronutrient status, infants from low- and middle-income countries are susceptible to cobalamin deficiency. However, data on plasma cobalamin and folate and the functional markers methylmalonic acid and total homocysteine from breastfed infants in Nepal are still needed. We collected plasma samples from 316 6–11-month-old breastfed infants with a length-for-age of less than minus one z-score and analyzed blood for plasma folate, cobalamin, methylmalonic acid and total homocysteine concentrations. Cobalamin deficiency (plasma cobalamin 148 pmol/L) was found among 11%, whereas 24% of the infants had plasma cobalamin concentrations between 148–221 pmol/L. Elevated total homocysteine (10 µmol/L) and methylmalonic acid (0.28 µmol/L) indicating functional cobalamin deficiency were found among 53% and 75% of the infants, respectively. Based on a combined indicator of cobalamin status, 58% were found to have low cobalamin status. However, folate deficiency (10 nmol/L) was not found as the lowest value of plasma folate was 20.7 nmol/L. It is important to examine the extent to which poor cobalamin status during infancy has immediate or long-term consequences.
