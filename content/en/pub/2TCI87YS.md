    <h1>About</h1>
    Risberg and Romani conducted a study to understand why highly skilled migrants struggle to find jobs that match their qualifications. Instead of focusing on the migrants themselves, they examined the role of organizations. Through a detailed analysis of a labor integration program in Sweden, they discovered that organizations often see highly skilled migrants as a threat to their established norms and practices. This perception leads to underemployment of these migrants, as companies aim to protect what they consider 'normal' operations. The study challenges the assumption that organizations are eager to hire migrants and highlights the need to rethink how 'normality' influences hiring decisions. This research is important because it sheds light on the barriers highly skilled migrants face and calls for a change in organizational hiring practices.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Why do highly skilled migrants encounter difficulties getting a skilled job? In this study, instead of searching for an answer in migrants’ characteristics, we turn to organizations and ask: why do organizations underemploy highly skilled migrants? With an in-depth qualitative study of a programme for highly skilled migrants’ labour integration in Sweden, we show that highly skilled migrants are perceived as a potential threat to organizational norms and practices. Using the relational theory of risk – approaching risk as socially constructed – the study provides a novel explanation for highly skilled migrants’ underemployment. It shows an organization logic protecting corporate practices seen as ‘normal’ from a perceived disruption that employing highly skilled migrants could possibly cause. Theoretical contributions to the understanding of highly skilled migrants’ employability are threefold: (1) the field assumption that organizations are in favour of hiring migrants is challenged; (2) highly skilled migrants’ underemployment is explained through a protective organizational logic; and (3) we stress the necessity to problematize an implicit reference to organizational normality when recruiting.
