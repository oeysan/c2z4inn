    <h1>About</h1>
    Horsfjord's book explores how religion influences various aspects of society, such as politics, identity, and culture. They argue that understanding religion's role in these areas is crucial, especially during times of change. The book examines how religion has shaped socio-cultural and political conflicts over the past twenty years. By drawing on multiple disciplines like sociology, philosophy, anthropology, politics, media, law, and theology, the essays provide insights into how religion impacts society and vice versa. This comprehensive approach helps readers grasp the complex interactions between religion and societal structures. The findings are particularly relevant for scholars and researchers interested in religious studies, politics, media, culture, and sociology, offering a deeper understanding of religion's pervasive influence.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    To talk about religion is to talk about politics, identity, terrorism, migration, gender, and a host of other aspects of society. This volume examines and engages with larger debates around religion and proposes a new approach that moves beyond the usual binaries to analyse its role in our societies at large. 
 
Formatting Religion delves into these complexities and demonstrates the topical need for better understanding of how religion, society, culture, and law interact and are mutually influenced in periods of transition. It examines how over the last two decades, people and institutions have been grappling with the role of religion in socio-cultural and political conflicts worldwide. Drawing on a host of disciplines – including sociology, philosophy, anthropology, politics, media, law, and theology – the essays in this book analyse how religion is formatted today, and how religion continuously formats society, from above and from below. 
 
The volume will be of great interest to scholars and researchers of religious studies, politics, media and culture studies, and sociology.
