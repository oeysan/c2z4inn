    <h1>About</h1>
    Ebrahimi et al. explored how tiny particles called exosomes, which are found in bodily fluids like blood, saliva, and urine, can help diagnose cancer. Exosomes carry important molecules from their parent cells, including non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which play crucial roles in cell functions and tumor growth. Because exosomes are abundant and easy to access, they could serve as reliable markers for detecting cancer early, predicting patient outcomes, monitoring treatment responses, and assessing the risk of cancer returning. However, the authors note that there are still challenges in standardizing methods to isolate and identify these exosomes for clinical use. This research highlights the potential of using exosomes in cancer diagnosis and treatment, which could significantly improve patient care.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Almost all clinical oncologists agree that the discovery of reliable, accessible, and non-invasive biomarkers is necessary to decrease cancer mortality. It is possible to employ reliable biomarkers to diagnose cancer in the early stages, predict the patient prognosis, follow up the response to treatment, and estimate the risk of disease recurrence with high sensitivity and specificity. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially exosomes, have been the focus of translational research to develop such biomarkers over the past decade. The abundance and distribution of exosomes in bodily fluids, including serum, saliva, and urine, as well as their ability to transport various biomolecules (nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids) derived from their parent cells, make exosomes reliable, accessible, and potent biomarkers for diagnosis and follow-up of solid and hematopoietic tumors. In addition, exosomes play a vital role in various cellular processes, including tumor progression, by participating in intercellular communication. Although these advantages underline the high potential of tumor-derived exosomes as diagnostic biomarkers, the lack of standardized effective methods for their isolation, identification, and precise characterization makes their application challenging in clinical settings. We discuss the importance of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in cellular processes, and the role of tumor-derived exosomes containing ncRNAs as potential biomarkers in several types of cancer. In addition, the advantages and challenges of these studies for translation into clinical applications are covered.
