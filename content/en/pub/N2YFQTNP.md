    <h1>About</h1>
    Salon et al. conducted a study to understand how lower body negative pressure (LBNP), which shifts blood to the lower body, affects the tiny blood vessels in the retina. They tested 44 participants, taking retinal images at different stages of LBNP using a special camera and software. Their analysis showed no significant changes in retinal microcirculation between different time points or between males and females. This means that the small blood vessels in the retina did not react differently to the blood shift caused by LBNP. The study is important because it is the first to explore this area, suggesting that more research is needed to see if higher levels of LBNP might show different results, especially in extreme conditions like severe blood loss.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Introduction: Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) is routinely used to induce central 
hypovolemia. LBNP leads to a shift in blood to the lower extremities. While the effects of LBNP on 
physiological responses and large arteries have been widely reported, there is almost no literature 
regarding how these cephalad fluid shifts affect the microvasculature. The present study evaluated 
the changes in retinal microcirculation parameters induced by LBNP in both males and females. 
Methodology: Forty-four participants were recruited for the present study. The retinal measurements 
were performed at six time points during the LBNP protocol. To prevent the development of 
cardiovascular collapse (syncope) in the healthy participants, graded LBNP until a maximum of 
âˆ’40 mmHg was applied. A non-mydriatic, hand-held Optomed Aurora retinal camera was used to 
capture the retinal images. MONA Reva software (version 2.1.1) was used to analyze the central retinal 
arterial and venous diameter changes during the LBNP application. Repeated measures ANOVAs, 
including sex as the between-subjects factor and the grade of the LBNP as the within-subjects factor, 
were performed. Results: No significant changes in retinal microcirculation were observed between 
the evaluated time points or across the sexes. Conclusions: Graded LBNP application did not lead to 
changes in the retinal microvasculature across the sexes. The present study is the first in the given 
area that attempted to capture the changes in retinal microcirculation caused by central hypovolemia 
during LBNP. However, further research is needed with higher LBNP levels, including those that can 
induce pre-fainting (presyncope), to fully understand how retinal microcirculation adapts during 
complete cardiovascular collapse (e.g., during hypovolemic shock) and/or during severe hemorrhage.
