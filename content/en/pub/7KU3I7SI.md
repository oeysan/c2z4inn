    <h1>About</h1>
    Erdvik et al. conducted a study to see if a two-year physical education (PE) program could improve students' feelings of autonomy, competence, and relatedness—key psychological needs. They compared traditional PE with a new "Interest-based PE" that offered students a choice between an explorative approach and a sports-focused approach. The study involved 693 students, with 348 choosing their preferred PE style. Girls and students who were less active in sports tended to choose the explorative approach. Despite these choices, the study found no significant differences in need satisfaction between the new PE program and traditional PE. However, sports-active students felt more connected to others than non-sports-active students. This suggests that simply offering different PE options may not be enough to ensure all students benefit equally.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Research shows that sports-active students experience more basic need satisfaction (autonomy, competence, relatedness) in physical education (PE) than their non-sports-active peers, and thus, reap most of the benefits of PE. This study aimed to investigate the role of a two-year PE programme, referred to as Interest-based PE, in contributing to students’ basic need satisfaction in PE, and in particular, to assess potential basic needs-benefits among students who were not involved in leisure-time sport. Among 693 students, 348 were offered a choice of two different PE approaches (“explorative” vs. “sports” approach) for the next two years, while the remaining students continued to receive traditional PE. Girls, non-sports-active students, and students who experienced less need satisfaction in PE at baseline were more likely to choose the explorative approach, thereby signifying a wish for a less sports-centred PE. However, no significant differences in autonomy, competence, and relatedness need satisfaction were identified between Interest-based PE groups and their respective control groups over the course of the programme. Sports active students experienced more gains in relatedness need satisfaction than non-sports active students over the course of the programme, suggesting that challenges in promoting equal opportunities for learning in PE may require more than “Interest-based PE”.
