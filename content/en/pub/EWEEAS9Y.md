    <h1>About</h1>
    Lekhal et al. conducted a study to see if the Thrive by Three program in childcare centers helps improve language skills in children aged 1 to 3. They looked at data from 78 childcare centers, 187 toddler classrooms, and 1561 children, mostly native Norwegian. The study found that children in the program showed slightly better language development than those not in the program, but the difference wasn't significant. Interestingly, the program seemed to benefit girls more than boys. Girls in the program learned 17 more words compared to those not in the program, while boys showed no significant difference. This research helps us understand how early interventions might work differently for boys and girls in developing language skills.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This study examined the effectiveness of the Thrive by Three 
intervention for 1- to 3-year-old’s language development. Data 
from 78 childcare centres, 187 toddler classrooms, and 1561 
children (91.4% native Norwegian) were included. Results 
revealed that children in the intervention group had slightly 
steeper language development than those in the control group, 
but the difference was not statistically significant. Since previous 
studies find language stimulation in childcare to differ based on 
gender, we also examined if the Thrive by Three intervention 
affected boys and girls differently. We found that effects of the 
intervention were only present for girls’ language development. 
Girls in the intervention group had an increase of 17 more words 
from baseline to post-intervention than those in the control 
group. There was no statistical difference in change of boys’ 
language development between the intervention and control 
group. Results are discussed in light of theories and literature that 
may explain our findings.
