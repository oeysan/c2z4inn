    <h1>About</h1>
    Larsen et al. conducted a study published in the International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-being, exploring how staff at a new mental health facility perceive their work environment. Using interviews and a phenomenological approach, they found that the physical space plays a significant role in patient care. Key insights include the importance of creating a healing atmosphere, the symbolic meaning of design, and how changes in the environment affect time and communication. The study highlights that while the new facility offers opportunities for better care, there are also challenges due to its design and organization that can hinder staff performance. Understanding these dynamics can help improve mental health care environments and staff satisfaction.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Introduction: Patients in mental health care rely on staff for their well-being, security, andquality of treatment. However, staff’s perspective of the physical environment where caretakes place remains underexplored. Their insights are crucial to understanding how theenvironment impacts the quality of care. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore themeanings of the physical environment for inpatient care according to staff shortly afterrelocation to a new mental health facility.Methods: The study employed a phenomenological approach and focus group interviewswith 20 staff working in a newly built mental health facility. Data were analysed using vanManen’s existentials and guided by the theory of affordances.Results: The primary findings were as follows: (a) attempting to provide a therapeutic atmo-sphere, (b) design as symbolism, (c) altering the physical environment means altering time,(d) offering spaces for connection and communication, and (e) embodying the new mentalhealth facility.Conclusion: The findings indicate that regardless of whether affordances are actualized,opportunities and obstacles in the hospital environment impact the staff’s ability to provideinpatient care according to their standards. Conflict arose due to obstacles inherent in theorganization and structure of the new mental health facility that limited opportunities toutilize possible affordances.
