    <h1>About</h1>
    Happell et al. conducted a study to understand nursing students' attitudes towards mental illness and mental health nursing in Europe and Australia. They found that nursing students generally had favorable views about mental health nursing as a career. However, attitudes towards mental illness varied, with students from Australia and Ireland showing more positive attitudes compared to those from Finland, Norway, and the Netherlands. This is important because attracting nurses to mental health care is crucial for improving the quality of mental health services. By understanding these attitudes, educators and policymakers can better address stigma and encourage more students to pursue careers in mental health nursing, ultimately benefiting patients and the healthcare system.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The stigma associated with a diagnosis of mental illness is well known yet has not reduced significantly in recent years. Health professionals, including nurses, have been found to share similar negative attitudes towards people with labelled with mental illness as the general public. The low uptake of mental health nursing as a career option reflects these stigmatised views and is generally regarded as one of the least popular areas of in which to establish a nursing career. The aim of the current project was to examine nursing students’ attitudes towards the concept of mental illness and mental health nursing across four European countries (Ireland, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands), and Australia, using the Opening Minds Scale and the Mental Health Nurse Education survey. The surveys were distributed to students prior to the commencement of the mental health theory component. Attitudes towards mental health nursing were generally favourable. Differences in opinion were evident in attitudes towards mental illness as a construct; with students from Australia and Ireland tending to have more positive attitudes than students from Finland, Norway and the Netherlands. The future quality of mental health services is dependent on attracting sufficient nurses with the desire, knowledge and attitudes to work in mental health settings. Understanding attitudes towards mental illness and mental health nursing is essential to achieving this aim.
