    <h1>About</h1>
    Løtveit and Bugge conducted a study to understand how student teachers perceive the concept of culture and how their views change over three years of teacher education. They collected data from students at a Norwegian teacher education institution in 2014 and 2017. Initially, many students described culture in local and personalized terms, but this tendency decreased by 2017. Despite some changes, many students still held static views of culture, though these views were less prevalent after three years of study. This research highlights the importance of evolving cultural understanding in teacher education, suggesting that prolonged education can shift perspectives from narrow, fixed definitions to broader, more dynamic ones. This shift is crucial for teachers to effectively address diverse cultural contexts in their future classrooms.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    How do novice student teachers understand the concept of culture? To 
what extent do their understandings of the concept change after three 
years of teacher education? These questions are discussed based on 
insights about various scholarly concepts of culture, which have 
developed over more than a century. In addition, theories of localism 
and individualisation are used. We discuss findings from a longitudinal 
quantitative study, with data collected in 2014 and 2017 at a Norwegian 
teacher education institution. In addition to questions with predefined 
answering alternatives, the students were invited to answer the 
following open question: “Can you, in your own words, explain what 
you mean by culture?” In this paper, we analyse and compare the 
responses to this question in 2014, when the students began their studies, 
and in 2017, after three years of study. One interesting finding is that 
many students define culture in quite local and personalised terms, 
although more so in 2014 than in 2017. Another important finding is that 
static understandings of culture prevail in both 2014 and 2017, although 
less so in 2017 than in 2014.
