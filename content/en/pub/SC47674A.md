    <h1>About</h1>
    Janssen et al. conducted a study on Dutch secondary vocational schoolteachers to understand their expectations and experiences with Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training. They interviewed teachers before, immediately after, and nine months after the training. Initially, teachers expected the training to help with stress and unpleasant feelings, and improve personal skills like being present and recognizing harmful patterns. After the training, teachers reported reduced stress, increased inner calmness, and enhanced mindfulness skills such as better concentration, acceptance, and compassion. These findings suggest that MBSR can positively impact teachers' mental health and prosocial abilities, making them more effective in their roles and improving their overall well-being.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Objectives In this qualitative study, we explored Dutch secondary vocational schoolteachers’ prior expectations of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training. We report on their short- and long-term experiences regarding mental health outcomes and personal or mindfulness/prosocial competencies. Method Between September 2016 and June 2020, we interviewed 32 teachers participating in a cluster randomised controlled trial prior to partaking in a MBSR training (T0); 27, immediately after the training (T1); and 16, 9 months after finishing the training (T3). No interviews were held on T2, 3 months after finishing the training. Qualitative data was analysed using directed content analysis. Results Analysis of the data at T0 resulted in five themes regarding the participants’ prior expectations related to the MBSR training. Data analysis at T1 and T3 resulted in 10 themes regarding their experiences, four of which were the same as at T0: one mental health outcome (i.e. stress and unpleasant feelings) and three personal competencies (i.e. being in the present, taking distance, and recognising and changing dysfunctional patterns). The fifth "other" theme at T0 was knowledge of mindfulness and of mindfulness skills. Six additional themes emerged related to a new mental health outcome (i.e. inner calmness and pleasant feelings) and five personal competencies (i.e. being aware, concentration, acceptance and non-judgment, communicating, and showing compassion towards yourself and others). Conclusion Our results suggest that MBSR can reduce teachers’ stress, increase inner calmness, and foster mindfulness and prosocial competencies. Preregistration The trial was registered with the Dutch Trial Register (www.trialregister.nl): NL5581 (July 2016).
