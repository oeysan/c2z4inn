    <h1>About</h1>
    Mary and Young conducted a study to help future primary teachers in France better support bilingual students. They found that many teachers struggle to accept and use languages other than French in their classrooms. To address this, the authors designed an elective course that used creative, interdisciplinary projects to teach student teachers about linguistic and cultural diversity. The course included activities from visual arts, technology, language development, psychology, and sociolinguistics. By engaging in projects like creating bilingual books and multilingual music collections, the student teachers learned to become "language activists," promoting the use of multiple languages in education. This approach aims to make classrooms more inclusive and supportive for bilingual students.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    eachers in France working with (emergent) bilingual pupils often not  
only feel ill-equipped to provide the specific support these learners  
require, but also find it difficult to accept that languages other than  
French have a right and role as learning resources in the classroom.  
Challenging such monolingual mindsets whilst helping teachers to  
understand, experience and experiment with the linguistic and cultural  
diversity of their classrooms requires innovative and creative approaches  
(Mary, Krüger & Young, 2021). In this paper, we present and analyse  
data collected from 14 students during 2019–2020 (pre & post-course  
questionnaires, student portfolios, written reflections and working  
group minutes) during an elective course offered to future (pre)primary  
teachers in France (N=40). The course was project-based and interdisciplinary, incorporating techniques, concepts and insights from the  
visual arts, new technologies, language acquisition and development,  
psychology and sociolinguistics. A key objective of the course was to  
empower student teachers to become agents of change or ‘language  
activists’ (Shohamy, 2006) through the implementation of creative projects for and with their (emergent) bilingual pupils. Students developed  
projects ranging from the creation of bilingual books and story bags to  
multilingual music collections, in collaboration with the children and  
families who frequented their schools.
