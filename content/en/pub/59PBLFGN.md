    <h1>About</h1>
    Ohlsson et al. conducted a study to understand how personality traits and political skills affect military staff members' performance. They focused on the Big Five personality dimensions, which include traits like openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The study involved 185 military personnel from various educational facilities. They found that certain personality traits and political skills were linked to better perceived performance. Specifically, conscientiousness (being diligent and responsible) played a key role in enhancing the impact of political skills on performance. This means that military staff who are both conscientious and skilled in navigating social situations tend to perform better. These findings can help improve training and development programs in the military.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The purpose was to explore the relationship and mediation effects between the Big Five personality dimensions, and political skill with military staff members’ perceived performance. The sample included 185 Armed Forces International staff members from several military education facilities. The results indicated that the PSI and several personality dimensions were positively correlated with individuals’ perceived performance. In addition, the personality dimension Conscientiousness acted as a statistically significant mediator between an individual’s use of political skills and their perceived performance. Practical considerations and future research directions are suggested.
