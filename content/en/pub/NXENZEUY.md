    <h1>About</h1>
    Smaliukienė et al. conducted a study on young men undergoing compulsory military training in Lithuania to understand how group dynamics affect stress levels. They measured hair cortisol, a marker of long-term stress, and looked at perceived stress and group cohesion (how well group members work together). They found that perceived stress influenced hair cortisol levels most when groups were forming and completing final tasks, but less during routine periods. Interpersonal cohesion (how well group members get along) and task cohesion (how well they work together on tasks) were key factors in predicting stress levels. This study highlights the importance of social interactions and teamwork in managing stress, suggesting that strong group dynamics can help reduce stress in challenging environments.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Previous research shows a nonlinear dependency between hair cortisol concentrations and perceived stress levels. This may be due to stress being targeted at the individual level despite it also being a social phenomenon which is often affected by group dynamics. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the influence of perceived stress on the hair cortisol level, considering the impact of the variables of group dynamics (interpersonal, task, and norm cohesion). Information was collected on 11 groups of, in total, 112 young men in three phases of time during their compulsory military training (covering nine months in total). The classification and regression tree (C&RT) method was used to predict hair cortisol concentrations in groups. The results show that the variability of the hair cortisol level in young men groups can be explained by perceived stress only when the groups were in formation process (47.7% normalised importance in Model 1) and when the groups were working on their final tasks (37.80% normalised importance in Model 3); meanwhile, the importance of perceived stress in explaining hair cortisol concentrations is low when the group is in a routine period of a group life-span (28.9% normalised importance in Model 2). Interpersonal cohesion (normalised importance 100% in Model 1 and 80.0% in Model 3) and task cohesion (normalised importance 78.6% in Model 2) were the most important predictors in the study area. These results point to the importance of the elements of group dynamics when it comes to explaining the nature of hair cortisol as accumulated stress biomarkers in young men.
