    <h1>About</h1>
    Tryggestad et al. explore the concept of "context" in organization and management studies in their book. They argue that context is often used vaguely and propose a more dynamic and relational understanding of it. By examining health care settings, they present a framework for studying context in action, focusing on how context is created and changed through interactions. The authors address key questions about what constitutes context, how people experience it, and how it evolves. They cover various topics like organizational change, policy implementation, and patient care. This book is useful for both researchers and practitioners, offering a practical approach to understanding and analyzing context in organizational settings.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Context is a central concept in organization and management studies, yet it is often used in a generalized, unspecific manner. This book offers an interactionist view on context as a dynamic, relational, and socially enacted phenomenon. It explores context in action and the theoretical, methodological, and analytical consequences of this approach through a collection of reflections and research experiences from the dynamic field of health care.  
 
In the opening chapters, the editors present their framework for studying context in action and outline three main approaches, centered on the following questions: What constitutes context for a phenomenon or an event? How do actors understand, experience, and engage with context? How do contexts change and what is the role of actors in such processes? Context and action are then explored through a range of topics such as enactment and organizational change, policy implementation, executive work, strategic change, materiality, technology, patients and relatives' perspectives, integrated care, quality improvement, and health care support work.  
 
Relevant to both management researchers and practitioners, this volume provides a definition of context as theoretical construct based on interactionist and process based perspectives, and a practical framework for studying context in action which the reader can use in their own work.
