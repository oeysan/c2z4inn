    <h1>About</h1>
    Standal and Aggerholm explore how physical education can justify its educational value by focusing on the development of skills and meaningful experiences. They examine the concept of habit, drawing on the ideas of philosophers Merleau-Ponty and John Dewey. Merleau-Ponty’s notion of habit helps explain how skills are acquired through repeated practice, while Dewey’s emphasis on habits, experience, and education highlights the importance of being attentive and engaged in physical activities. This study suggests that physical education is valuable because it helps students develop practical skills and fosters positive, embodied experiences, which are essential for overall personal growth and attentiveness. Understanding these relationships can help educators create more effective and meaningful physical education programs.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    One of the main topics in philosophical work dealing with physical education is if and how the subject can justify its educational value. Acquisition of practical knowledge in the form of skills and the provision of positive and meaningful embodied experiences are central to the justification of physical education. The purpose of this article is to explore the relationship between skill and embodied experience in physical education through the notion and concept of habit. The literature on phenomenology of skill acquisition is first considered. In particular, we draw on Merleau-Ponty’s notion of habit. Further, we introduce pragmatist philosophy and in particular the work of John Dewey as a useful complement to the phenomenological perspective. It is in particular Dewey’s emphasis on habits, experience and education that are found to be useful in our exploration of the relationship between the two justifications under consideration, because it allows us to point out the importance of habits of attentiveness.
