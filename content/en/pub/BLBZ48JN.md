    <h1>About</h1>
    Brendbekken et al. conducted a study to understand what helps people with chronic musculoskeletal pain return to work after being on sick leave. They compared two groups: one received a comprehensive treatment involving various specialists, while the other received a simpler, less intensive treatment. They found that those who underwent the multidisciplinary program were more likely to return to work within three months. Factors like believing work caused their pain and having anxiety or depression also influenced their return. Interestingly, people who felt unsupported at work benefited more from the intensive program. However, after 12 months, the only factor that mattered was how long they had been on sick leave initially. This study suggests that a thorough treatment approach can speed up recovery for some individuals.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Objective: To assess the predictive effect of a multidisciplinary 
intervention programme, pain, workrelated 
factors and health, including anxiety/depression 
and beliefs, on return-to-work for patients 
sick-listed due to musculoskeletal pain. 
Design: A randomized clinical study. 
Methods: A total of 284 patients were randomized 
to either a multidisciplinary intervention programme 
(n=141) or to a less resource-demanding brief 
intervention (n=143). Work participation was estimated 
monthly from register data for 12 months. 
Return-to-work was defined as increased work participation 
in 3 consecutive months. 
Results: In the adjusted model, return-to-work by 3 
months was associated with a multidisciplinary intervention 
programme (odds ratio (OR)=2.7, 95% 
confidence interval (95% CI)=1.1–6.9), the factor 
“belief that work was cause of the pain” (OR=2.2, 
95% CI=1.1–4.3), anxiety and depression (OR=0.5, 
95% CI=0.2–0.98), and by an interaction between 
the multidisciplinary intervention and perceived 
support at work (OR=0.3, 95% CI=0.1–0.9). At 12 
months, only duration of sick leave was associated 
with return-to-work (OR=0.6, 95% CI=0.5–0.8). 
Conclusion: Multidisciplinary intervention may hasten 
return-to-work and benefit those who perceive 
low support at work, but at 12 months only duration 
of sick leave at baseline was associated with returnto-work.
