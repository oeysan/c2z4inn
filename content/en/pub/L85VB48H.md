    <h1>About</h1>
    Benediktsson conducted a study comparing student teachers' experiences with culturally responsive assessment in Denmark and Iceland. They interviewed 24 student teachers who were nearing the end of their education. The teachers discussed various assessment practices, emphasizing the importance of considering students' cultural and linguistic backgrounds. They also highlighted the need to assess children's well-being. While the student teachers showed positive attitudes towards cultural diversity, they criticized their teacher education programs for not adequately covering culturally responsive assessment. This gap left them with a basic understanding of the topic. The findings suggest that teacher education programs need to better prepare future teachers to effectively assess students from diverse backgrounds, which is crucial for fostering inclusive and supportive learning environments.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This paper explores and compares student teachers’ experiences and perspectives on culturally responsive assessment in compulsory schooling in Denmark and Iceland. The study’s theoretical framework draws on scholarship on culturally responsive assessment. The data was derived from fourteen interviews with Danish student teachers and ten interviews with Icelandic student teachers. As per the selection criteria, all participants had to be in the final stages of their education process, meaning they had completed their on-site schoolteacher training and most courses in their teacher education programme. During the interviews, the participants reflected on pre-instructional, formative, and summative assessment practices with cultural diversity in mind. Furthermore, they discussed the importance of assessing children’s well-being. In both countries, the participants demonstrated positive attitudes towards cultural diversity and expressed awareness of considering children’s cultural and linguistic backgrounds when assessing them. On the other hand, most participants expressed criticism of teacher education programmes for lacking attention to the topic of culturally responsive assessment, which resulted in their rudimentary understanding of the theoretical underpinnings.
