    <h1>About</h1>
    Von Hoermann et al. conducted a study to understand what factors influence the communities of decomposers (organisms that break down dead material) on animal carcasses, comparing them to those on deadwood. They found that while some factors like decay stage and microclimate affect both carrion and deadwood decomposers, there are notable differences. For example, the identity of the carcass (type of animal) was more important for beetles and bacteria on carrion than on deadwood. This suggests that both carrion and deadwood provide unique environments that support diverse decomposer communities. Understanding these differences helps us appreciate how various types of dead material contribute to ecosystem health and biodiversity.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Research on decomposer communities has traditionally focused on plant litter or deadwood. Even though carrion forms highly nutrient-rich necromass that enhance ecosystem heterogeneity, the factors influencing saprophytic communities remain largely unknown. For deadwood, experiments have shown that different drivers determine beetles (i.e., decay stage, microclimate, and space), fungi (i.e., decay stage and tree species) and bacteria (decay stage only) assemblages. To test the hypothesis that similar factors also structure carrion communities, we sampled 29 carcasses exposed for 30 days that includedCervus elaphus(N = 6),Capreolus capreolus(N = 18), andVulpes vulpes(N = 5) in a mountain forest throughout decomposition. Beetles were collected with pitfall traps, while microbial communities were characterized using amplicon sequencing. Assemblages were determined with a focus from rare to dominant species using Hill numbers. With increasing focus on dominant species, the relative importance of carcass identity on beetles and space on bacteria increased, while only succession and microclimate remained relevant for fungi. For beetle and bacteria with focus on dominant species, host identity was more important than microclimate, which is in marked contrast to deadwood. We conclude that factors influencing carrion saprophytic assemblages show some consistency, but also differences from those of deadwood assemblages, suggesting that short-lived carrion and long-lasting deadwood both provide a resource pulse with different adaptions in insects and microbes. As with deadwood, a high diversity of carcass species under multiple decay stages and different microclimates support a diverse decomposer community.
