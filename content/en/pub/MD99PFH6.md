    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    Knowledge is the most important asset in education. Knowledge Management has been the focus for many years in higher education. Recently, universities have embraced innovative processes that could foster a better learning process. Digital learning platforms such as Canvas or Blackboard has been deployed at the higher education to facilitate the learning process. However, it is still recognized that knowledge might not be fully acquired by students. Adoption of technological artifacts has proven to be a good step forward; however, it seems not sufficient. Lately there has been a focus on how to implement student centric methodologies to foster learning effectiveness. For instance, Project-based learning (Trullàs, Blay, Sarri, &amp; Pujol) approach intends to provide to students the possibility to be engaged in project reflecting similar issues suchin real life in order to further develop skills and competences. This paper outlines two approaches based on the leitmotiv “learning by doing” and on the implication of students in defining jointly a use case for their home exams. The paper presents 3 experiences from 3 universities based in Norway and Spain. A model for an effective learning in Higher Education is delineated.
