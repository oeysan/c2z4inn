    <h1>About</h1>
    Von Hoerman et al. conducted a study in the Bavarian Forest National Park in Germany to understand how the placement of animal carcasses affects beetle diversity. They found that beetle diversity was higher at fixed locations compared to randomly placed carcasses. This is important because fixed locations create nutrient-rich areas that serve as refuges for rare and threatened beetle species, such as Necrobia violacea. The study identified 92 beetle species at 29 carcasses, including rare species like Necrophilus subterraneus and Sphaerites glabratus. These findings highlight the importance of leaving wildlife carcasses in specific areas within protected forests to support biodiversity and conservation efforts for beetles, which play a crucial role in decomposition.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Whereas vertebrate scavengers have a higher diversity reported at randomly placed carcasses, the drivers of insect diversity on carrion, such as the exposure type (fixed versus random) or the carrion species, are still incompletely understood. We analyzed beetle diversity at differently exposed carcasses in the low-range mountain forest of the Bavarian Forest National Park in Germany. We tested if scavenging beetles, similarly to vertebrate scavengers, show a higher diversity at randomly placed carcasses compared to easily manageable fixed places. Ninety-two beetle species at 29 exposed wildlife carcasses (roe, red deer, and red foxes) were detected. Beetle diversity was higher at fixed locations possessing extended highly nutrient-rich cadaver decomposition islands as important refuges for threatened red-listed species, such as Necrobia violacea (Coleoptera: Cleridae). Particularly noticeable in our insect traps were the following two rare species, the “primitive” carrion beetle Necrophilus subterraneus (Coleoptera: Agyrtidae) and the false clown beetle Sphaerites glabratus (Coleoptera: Sphaeritidae). In Europe, only the species S. glabratus out of the genus Sphaerites is present. This emphasizes the importance of carrion for biodiversity conservation. We clearly show the relevance of leaving and additional providing wildlife carcasses in a dedicated place in protected forests for preserving very rare and threatened beetle species as essential members of the decomposing community.
