    <h1>About</h1>
    Felton et al. conducted a review of studies on how northern cervids (like deer and moose) choose their food based on its chemical content. They found that while many studies show that factors like energy, protein, fiber, minerals, and plant chemicals influence food choices, these animals don't just focus on one nutrient. Instead, they need a balanced intake of several nutrients at once. The authors suggest that future research should look at multiple food components together to understand these complex interactions better. They also note that the season affects food choices, especially fiber content, but there's no strong evidence that cervids prefer more protein in summer than in winter. New technologies are needed to study nutrient intake in wild animals more effectively.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The research literature on food selection by large herbivores is extensive. Still, we are generally 
lacking in our knowledge of the inﬂuence of potentially interacting chemical contents of the food. We made 
a qualitative review of a systematic literature search of studies that empirically link chemical contents of 
food to the food selection by northern cervids (genera Alces, Capreolus, Cervus, Dama, Odocoileus, Rangifer). 
We found that although the majority of the 98 relevant studies measuring any given food constituent 
(energy, protein, ﬁber, minerals, plant secondary metabolites) provided support for it acting as a driver of 
food selection (in either a negative or positive way), there was little support for the traditional hypotheses 
of maximization or limitation of any single constituent. Rather, because of the animals’ need to acquire an 
appropriate intake of several constituents at the same time, our review highlights how new empirical stud- 
ies need to focus on several food constituents in synchrony: (1) Study designs should capture sufﬁcient 
variation in the content of food constituents in order to tease apart their many co-variations; and (2) 
insights about nutritional drivers may be lost if one uses only composite currencies such as crude energy, 
crude ﬁber, ash, or tannins, which may mask contrasting selection patterns of the lumped constituents. 
Season had an apparent inﬂuence on the selection of some food constituents, particularly various ﬁber frac- 
tions. In contrast, our review revealed a lack of evidence that cervids more strongly select for protein in 
summer than they do in winter. Our overall conclusion of the review is that interacting chemical contents 
of food make the nutritional value of a given food type into a varying entity. To better elucidate this varia- 
tion, we need new technologies that non-invasively capture nutrient intake of free-ranging animals, across 
seasons.
