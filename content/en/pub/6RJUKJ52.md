    <h1>About</h1>
    Burström et al. conducted a study to compare musculoskeletal symptoms between drivers of mining vehicles and non-drivers at open-pit mines in Finland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. They surveyed 1323 workers, asking about symptoms in specific body regions over the past year and their severity in the past month. The study found that lower back pain was the most common symptom, followed by pain in the neck, shoulder, and upper back. Interestingly, Nordic drivers reported fewer symptoms than non-drivers, while Russian drivers reported more. Daily driving of mining vehicles did not significantly affect the risk of symptoms. Female drivers reported more symptoms than male drivers. Overall, the study found only weak evidence that driving mining vehicles increases musculoskeletal symptoms.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Objectives: This cross-sectional questionnaire study was carried out at 4 open-pit mines in Finland, Norway, Russia and Sweden as part of the MineHealth project. The aim has been to compare the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms between drivers of mining vehicles and non-drivers. Material and Methods: The mine workers were asked whether they had suffered from any musculoskeletal symptoms during the previous 12 months in specified body regions, and to grade the severity of these symptoms during the past month. They were also asked about their daily driving of mining vehicles. Results: The questionnaire was completed 
by 1323 workers (757 vehicle drivers) and the reported prevalence and severity of symptoms were highest for the lower back, followed by pain in the neck, shoulder and upper back. Drivers in the Nordic mines reported fewer symptoms than non-drivers, while for Russian mine workers the results were the opposite of that. The daily driving of mining vehicles had no significant association with the risk of symptoms. Female drivers indicated a higher prevalence of symptoms as compared to male drivers. 
Conclusions: The study provided only weak support for the hypothesis that drivers of vehicles reported a higher prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms than non-vehicle drivers. There were marked differences in the prevalence of symptoms among workers in various enterprises, even though the nature of the job tasks was similar.
