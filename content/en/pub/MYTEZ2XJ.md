    <h1>About</h1>
    Engen explores the development of metacognition, which is the ability to think about one's own thinking, and reading strategies. They argue that these skills were discussed by Vygotsky in the 1930s, much earlier than commonly believed. Vygotsky suggested that metacognitive skills develop through learning and working with academic concepts, rather than being innate abilities. This idea contrasts with current mainstream research, such as the PIRLS study, which assumes that elementary students already use metacognitive skills to understand reading. Engen's findings highlight the importance of instructional methods in developing these critical thinking skills, suggesting that educators should focus on teaching academic concepts to foster metacognition in students. This insight can help improve educational practices and student learning outcomes.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The paper addresses the concepts of metacognition and (reading) strategies, the origin of which is usually traced back to the 1970s. However, the paper argues that conscious awareness, which Vygotsky introduced as early as the 1930s, is another term for metacognition. Further, according to Vygotsky, “… conscious awareness enters through the gate opened up by scientific concept” (Vygotsky 1987: 191, italics added), meaning that metacognitive skills develop in instruction, as a function of student’s work with academic concepts. This hypothesis, however, seems to be ignored by contemporary, mainstream researchers. For example, an influential study like PIRLS, contradictory to Vygotsky’s hypothesis, assumes that students already at the end of the elementary stage apply metacognitive skills – included reading strategies – in order to construct meaning in reading.
