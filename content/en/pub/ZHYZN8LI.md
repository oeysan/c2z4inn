    <h1>About</h1>
    Alem et al. conducted a study on the economic performance of crop-producing farms in Norway, focusing on 455 farms from 1991 to 2013. They found that these farms operated at about 78-81% efficiency. Key factors influencing performance included farm management practices like crop rotation and socioeconomic elements such as government support. The study suggests that less efficient farms could improve by adopting practices from more successful farms. For taxpayers and consumers, the subsidies provided to farmers help increase food production efficiency, potentially making food more affordable. The authors highlight the need for more detailed analysis of subsidy impacts to better understand their effects on farm performance.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the economic performance of Norwegian crop farms using 
a stochastic frontier analysis. 
Design/methodology/approach – The analysis was based on a translog cost function and unbalanced 
farm-level panel data for 1991–2013 from 455 Norwegian farms specialized in crop production in eastern and 
central regions of Norway. 
Findings – The results of the analysis show that the mean efficiency was about 78–81 percent. Farm 
management practices and socioeconomic factors were shown to significantly affect the economic 
performance of Norwegian crop farms. 
Research limitations/implications – Farmers are getting different types of support from the government 
and the study does not account for the different effects of different kinds of subsidy on cost efficiency. 
Different subsidies might have different effects on farm performance. To get more informative and useful 
results, it would be necessary to repeat the analysis with less aggregated data on subsidy payments. 
Practical implications – One implication for farmers (and their advisers) is that many of them are less 
efficient than the estimated benchmark (best performing farms). Thus, those lagging behind the best 
performing farms need to look at the way they are operating and to seek out ways to save costs or increase 
crop production. Perhaps there are things for lagging farmers to learn from their more productive farming 
neighbors. For instance, those farmers not practicing crop rotation might be well advised to try that practice. 
Social implications – For both taxpayers and consumers, one implication is that the contributions they pay 
that go to subsidize farmers appear to bring some benefits in terms of more efficient production that, in turn, 
increase the supply of some foods so possibly making food prices more affordable. 
Originality/value – Unlike previous performance studies in the literature, the authors estimated farm-level 
economic performance accounting for the contribution of both an important farm management practice and 
selected socioeconomic factors. Good farm management practices, captured through crop rotation, land 
tenure, government support and off-farm activities were found to have made a positive and statistically 
significant contribution to reducing the cost of production on crop-producing farms in the Central and 
Eastern regions of Norway.
