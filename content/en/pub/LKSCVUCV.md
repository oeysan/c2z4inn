    <h1>About</h1>
    Tolgfors et al. conducted a study to understand how a specific teaching method called "Movement Composition" transitions from Physical Education Teacher Education (PETE) to school Physical Education (PE). Movement Composition focuses on creative and collaborative movement activities rather than traditional sports techniques. The authors interviewed PETE students and experienced PE teachers, and analyzed course materials to see how this method is taught and applied in schools. They found that Movement Composition, which encourages creativity and teamwork, is successfully integrated into school PE, showing that PETE can influence school PE to include more diverse and student-centered activities. This matters because it suggests that PE can go beyond just sports, fostering creativity and collaboration among students.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background: Scholars have suggested that students’ views of what is 
important for them to know as Physical Education (PE) teachers are a 
result of what is assessed in Physical Education Teacher Education 
(PETE). Thus, there is a risk that students will reproduce content areas 
such as sports and assess sport-techniques without much critical 
consideration. In this study, however, the risk of reproducing what is 
prioritised in PETE is seen as an opportunity regarding the potential 
reproduction of other content areas than sports. Based on the 
regulative principles of PE and PETE that privilege sport skills and 
hinder creative movement learning, we focus on a content area in PETE 
that provides opportunities for students to engage in creative 
collaboration and examine how this content area is realised in school 
PE. Hence, we have chosen to explore ‘Movement Composition’, a 
content area which has a long tradition at one of the PETE universities 
in Sweden. Based on an overarching interest in whether and how PETE 
matters, this exploratory study focuses on the potential transferability of 
Movement Composition as a particular content area in the transition 
from PETE to PE. 
Purpose and research question: The purpose of this study is to explore 
Movement Composition as a content area undergoing the transition from 
PETE to school PE. The research question is: How is the pedagogic 
discourse of Movement Composition constructed, recontextualised and 
realised in the transition from PETE to school PE? 
Methods: Data was generated through an interview with one of the 
initiators of Movement Composition. Stimulated Recall interviews and 
Zoom interviews were also conducted with a group of five PETE 
students and three experienced PE teachers. In addition, documents 
such as the study guide, course literature, and written assignments 
associated with Movement Composition in the PETE programme were 
included in the empirical material. In the analysis, the combination of 
Bernstein’s pedagogic device and the Swedish didactics of PE research 
tradition was used to identify the pedagogic discourse of Movement 
Composition in the transition from PETE to school PE. 
Findings: The findings show how the pedagogic discourse of Movement 
Composition as a content area is constructed, recontextualised and realised 
in the transition from PETE to school PE. The construction of Movement 
Composition as a pedagogic discourse in PETE is about how the content area (the what) is selected and organised for pedagogical 
purposes. The recontextualisation of Movement Composition is about 
how the pedagogic discourse is interpreted and translated in relation to 
the PE syllabus. The realisation of Movement Composition involves how 
the content area in PETE is implemented in PE practice. 
Conclusions: This exploratory study has shown that what is articulated as 
a relevant content area and the way it is taught, learned, and assessed in 
PETE in many regards survives the transition to school PE. The transition 
from PETE to school PE does not only involve reproduction of sports 
and sport-techniques from one context to another. PETE also 
contributes to the use of creative, collaborative, and student-centred 
learning tasks in school PE.
