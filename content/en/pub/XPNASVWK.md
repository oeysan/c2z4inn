    <h1>About</h1>
    Dellsén explores the concept of scientific progress by comparing four different ideas about how science improves over time. They discuss whether progress means getting closer to the truth, solving scientific problems more effectively, accumulating more knowledge, or increasing our understanding to explain and predict phenomena better. Each of these ideas has its own strengths and weaknesses, and Dellsén examines the main arguments for and against each one. Understanding these different perspectives helps us appreciate how science evolves and why certain changes in scientific theories are considered advancements. This study is important because it helps clarify what we mean by progress in science, which can influence how research is conducted and evaluated.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Scientists are constantly making observations, carrying out experiments, and analyzing empirical data. Meanwhile, scientific theories are routinely being adopted, revised, discarded, and replaced. But when are such changes to the content of science improvements on what came before? This is the question of scientific progress. One answer is that progress occurs when scientific theories “get closer to the truth,” i.e., increase their degree of truthlikeness. A second answer is that progress consists in increasing theories' effectiveness for solving scientific problems. A third answer is that progress occurs when the stock of scientific knowledge accumulates. A fourth and final answer is that scientific progress consists in increasing scientific understanding,i.e., the capacity to correctly explain and reliably predict relevant phenomena. This paper compares and contrasts these four accounts of scientific progress, considers some of the most prominent arguments for and against each account, and briefly explores connections to different forms of scientific realism.
