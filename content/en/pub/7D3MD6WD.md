    <h1>About</h1>
    Tinkov et al. conducted a review and meta-analysis to explore the link between cadmium exposure and atherosclerosis, a condition where arteries become clogged with fatty substances. They found that higher levels of cadmium in urine and blood were associated with increased risk of death from cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes. This association was observed even in people who never smoked. Cadmium exposure was also linked to changes in cholesterol levels, including higher total cholesterol and LDL (bad cholesterol), and lower HDL (good cholesterol). The authors suggest that cadmium may contribute to atherosclerosis through mechanisms like oxidative stress (cell damage from free radicals), inflammation, and disruptions in normal cell functions. This research highlights the potential health risks of cadmium exposure in everyday life.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Cadmium has been proposed to be the one of the factors of atherosclerosis development, although the existing data are still controversial. The primary objective of the present study is the review and the meta-analysis of studies demonstrating the association between Cd exposure and atherosclerosis as well as review of the potential mechanisms of such association. We performed a systematic search in the PubMed-Medline database using the MeSH terms cadmium, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, mortality and humans up through December 20, 2017. Elevated urinary Cd levels were associated with increased mortality for cardiovascular disease (HR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.07–1.67) as well as elevated blood Cd levels (HR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.24–2.56). Analysis restricted to never smokers showed similar, though more imprecise, results. Consistently, we also observed an association between Cd exposure markers (blood and urine) and coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Moreover, Cd exposure was associated with atherogenic changes in lipid profile. High Cd exposure was associated with higher TC levels (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.10–2.01), higher LDL-C levels (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 0.99–1.73) and lower HDL-C levels (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.09–3.55). The mechanisms of atherogenic effect of cadmium may involve oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, enhanced lipid synthesis, up-regulation of adhesion molecules, prostanoid dysbalance, as well as altered glycosaminoglycan synthesis.
