    <h1>About</h1>
    Aasheim et al. conducted a study to see if the Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management (IY-TCM) program could improve relationships between teachers and students, as well as increase parent involvement in schools. They tested this program in Norwegian schools with students aged 6-8 years. Teachers from 21 schools using the program were compared to teachers from 23 schools that did not. The study found modest improvements in teacher-student relationships, with less conflict and more closeness, especially for students at higher risk. Additionally, teachers reported better parent involvement in school activities, though there was no change in their overall bonding with parents. These findings suggest that the IY-TCM program can positively impact teacher-student interactions and parent participation in schools.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This quasi-experimental pre–post comparison group design examined if the Incredible Years (IY)Teacher Classroom Management (TCM) programme implemented as a school-wide universal pre-ventive intervention to students aged 6–8 years at the lower primary level in a regular school settinghad an effect on teacher–student relationships and teacher–parent involvement. The IY-TCMtraining was delivered simultaneously to the entire group of school staff in first to third grade. Tea-cher reports in 21 intervention schools were compared to teacher reports in 23 control schools. Atotal of 241 teachers and 1,518 students took part in the trial. Linear mixed model analyses suggestmodest positive effects on change in teacher–student closeness (dw=0.22) and conflict(dw=0.15), where a moderator analysis showed a significantly higher treatment effect for high-riskstudents on change in teacher–student conflict. A positive effect was found on change in teacher-reported parent involvement in school (dw=0.40), however, not on change in teacher-reportedbonding with parents. Results suggest a potential preventive impact of the IY-TCM programme onchange in teacher–student relationships and teacher–parent involvement when implemented as auniversal preventive intervention in a regular school setting.
