    <h1>About</h1>
    Ragnarsdottir et al. examined how language policies and practices in Icelandic preschools affect immigrant families. They interviewed preschool principals and teachers from three schools to understand how state, municipal, and school policies support multilingualism. The study found that while preschool staff generally have positive attitudes towards multilingual practices, there is a need for more structured approaches to integrate the diverse languages and cultures of families. Additionally, stronger partnerships with parents from various linguistic backgrounds are necessary. The authors suggest that teacher education should include both theoretical and practical training in multicultural and multilingual education to better prepare teachers for the diversity they encounter in schools. This research highlights the importance of improving educational practices to support all children’s linguistic and cultural needs.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This article aims at exploring family language policies and practices of immigrant families in Iceland as well as educational practices and partnerships in their children’s preschools. The article draws on interviews with preschool principals and teachers in three preschools in Iceland, and presents findings related to state, municipal, and school language policies as well as multilingual practices in these preschools. The findings indicate that despite the generally positive attitudes and interest in multilingual practices among preschool personnel, there is room for improvement in terms of more structured and systematic integration of the diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds of families, as well as fostering stronger partnerships with parents from different linguistic and cultural communities. Furthermore, teacher education should include both theoretical and practical knowledge of multicultural and multilingual education to better equip teachers for cultural and linguistic diversity in schools.
