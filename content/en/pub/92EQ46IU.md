    <h1>About</h1>
    Murphy et al. conducted a study to explore how people connect with nature and why it matters for health and well-being. They used a modified Delphi method, which typically gathers expert opinions, but expanded it to include "expanded experts" like artists, city planners, and activists who have real-world experience with nature. Participants shared their experiences in interviews, which were analyzed to identify themes about nature connectedness. These insights will help develop a new scale to measure how connected people feel to nature. Understanding this connection can lead to better nature-based interventions, especially for urban residents, enhancing their quality of life and promoting environmental health.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background A vital element to understanding the the health and wellbeing of both humans and the environment is human-nature interactions. The biophilia hypothesis is referred to when discussing these interactions. This hypothesis suggests that due to evolution, humans have an innate urge to seek out nature. The concept of nature connectedness was developed from this hypothesis and is rooted in the belief that human identity and nature can be intertwined. This research aims to explore the intricate details of how an individual builds this connection in a meaningful way. Methods This is done using a modified Delphi method. A Delphi study in its typical form aims to gather the consensus of a group of experts in a specific area of interest. This modified Delphi aims to break down the barrier between the public and the experts by creating a second category of participants referred to as our ‘expanded experts.’ Expand experts are described as individuals with lived experience of being connected to nature in the everyday. This category comprises of artists, city planners, activists and many more. This allows for a much more inclusive and real-world exploration of experiences. The participants will first take part in a semi-structured interview process to investigate their experiences of connecting with nature. Following a hybrid thematic analysis with both deductive and indictive coding will be applied to the interviews. These themes will be shared with participants for them to weigh the importance of the theme to the construct to allow a deeper understanding of our interactions with nature. Results The results of this project will contribute to and shape the development of a state-of-the-art nature-connectedness scale. Furthermore, understanding how nature connectedness fits into our modern world will allow for more appropriate nature-based interventions for urban residents and beyond.
