    <h1>About</h1>
    Wangensteen et al. conducted a study to understand how people affected by substance use problems make sense of their experiences. They interviewed seven young people with parents who have substance use disorders and seven patients undergoing treatment. The study found that both groups tried to find meaning in their situations, behaviors, and the attitudes of those around them. They explored how these problems develop and persist, and how stigma and shame impact their lives. The authors suggest that psychoeducation (learning about psychological issues) and conversations with professionals can help individuals cope with the negative feelings associated with substance use problems. This research highlights the importance of support and education in dealing with addiction and its effects on families.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background: The complexity of substance use problems is hard to understand, both for those who suffer from it and for their children. This study aimed to explore how people affected by it conceptualized and understood substance use problems. 
 
Methods: Seven young people with parents with substance use disorder (SUD) and seven patients in SUD treatment participated in in-depth interviews. 
 
Results: The analysis revealed that the informants’ narratives included a search for meaning about concrete experienced situations and behaviors connected to substance use, attempts to understand the development and maintenance of the problems and the nearby environments’ stances and attitudes toward people with substance use problems and their children. 
 
Conclusion: The findings are discussed in light of theory about the creation of meaning through narratives and theories about stigma and shame. The article concludes that psychoeducation and conversations with professionals may contribute to cope with the stigma and shame related to substance use problems.
