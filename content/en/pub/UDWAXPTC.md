    <h1>About</h1>
    Moraczewska conducted a study on bilingual subject instruction in Norwegian schools, focusing on Polish-Norwegian classrooms. They explored how teachers use students' home languages to help them understand and learn new subjects. By analyzing recorded interactions between a bilingual teacher and three students, the study found that switching between languages (translanguaging) is crucial for effective teaching. The teacher used various techniques to help students understand and produce knowledge, integrating their previous experiences and knowledge. This approach, called scaffolding, helps students feel included and supports their learning in both content and language. The findings show that using students' home languages in teaching can significantly enhance their understanding and participation in class.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Bilingual subject instruction (BSI) is one form of language support classes in Norwegian schools, preparing students from language minorities for mainstream instruction by combining subject and language tutoring through the students’ home language. This article examines interactions within a Polish–Norwegian classroom setting, focusing on the concept of pedagogical translanguaging and scaffolding for epistemic inclusion of student resources. Grounded in the framework of translanguaging pedagogy and scaffolding techniques for student comprehension and production, the study involves a micro‐analysis of recorded dyadic interactions between a bilingual teacher and three students in individual BSI classes. The findings highlight language shifts as integral to teacher–student interactions, demonstrating the diligent use of scaffolding techniques for co‐constructing knowledge. The study underscores the mediating role of translanguaging practices in supporting both content and language knowledge, emphasizing the active integration of students’ previous knowledge and experiences for fostering epistemic inclusion.
