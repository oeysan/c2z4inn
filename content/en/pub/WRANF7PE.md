    <h1>About</h1>
    Jansen et al. conducted a study to investigate how bariatric surgery, a weight-loss procedure, affects certain chemicals in the body called persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and their potential impact on hormones. They studied 63 severely obese individuals and measured levels of hormones like adiponectin, leptin, and ghrelin, as well as various POPs, before and 12 months after surgery. They found that after surgery, levels of adiponectin and POPs increased significantly, while leptin levels decreased. Notably, the increase in one POP, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), explained a significant portion of the rise in adiponectin. These findings suggest that the release of POPs during weight loss surgery could have important effects on hormone levels, which might impact metabolic health. Further research is needed to understand these effects better.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background 
Bariatric surgery results in weight loss, marked endocrine changes and the release of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The release of POPs might cause endocrine disruption. The study aimed to explore associations between POPs and adiponectin, leptin and ghrelin in subjects undergoing bariatric surgery. Methods: The study included 63 subjects with severe obesity (men/women: 13/50), age (years): 45.0 (8.5), and BMI (kg/m2) 39.1 (3.4). Analyses of adiponectin, leptin and ghrelin and POPs (hexachlorobenzene (HCB), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p’-DDE), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 118 (dioxin-like compound; dl), and sum 6 PCB (PCB 28, -52, −101, −138, −153, and −180) were performed before and 12 months after bariatric surgery. Results: There were significant increases in adiponectin and all POPs and a fall in leptin after surgery. The main finding was the highly significant associations between adiponectin and all POPs. The increase in HCB explained 38% of the variation in adiponectin. Conclusions: If the POP-associated increase in adiponectin is a causal effect, the release of POPs might have important clinical consequences. Adiponectin has both positive and negative clinical effects exerted by essentially unknown mechanisms. The effects of released POPs on the metabolic functions in subjects undergoing bariatric surgery deserve further evaluation.
