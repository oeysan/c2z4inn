    <h1>About</h1>
    Granrud et al. conducted a study to understand how public health nurses in Norway perceive working with other professionals to address mental health issues among adolescents in secondary schools. They interviewed 18 nurses and found that collaboration is influenced by the school's formal structure, with teachers being the key decision-makers. Nurses felt they were important but not always recognized as essential partners. The study highlights the need for nurses to make their skills and roles more visible to improve teamwork. This is crucial because better collaboration can enhance support for adolescents facing mental health challenges, ultimately benefiting their overall well-being and academic success.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Aims and objectives 
To describe the variation in public health nurses' perceptions of interprofessional collaboration related to adolescents' mental health problems in secondary schools in Norway. 
 
Background 
Mental health problems among adolescents account for a large portion of the global burden of disease and affect 10%–20% of adolescents worldwide. Public health nurses in school health services play an important role in disease prevention and promotion of physical and mental health. In order to serve adolescents with regard to mental health problems, public health nurses are dependent on collaboration with other professionals in schools. 
 
Design 
Qualitative interviews were conducted with 18 public health nurses working in the school health services. 
 
Method 
A phenomenographic approach was used for interviewing and for analysing the qualitative interviews. This study is presented in line with COREQ's checklist. 
 
Result 
The analysis resulted in three descriptive categories based on eight identified conceptions. The categories are as follows: “The formal structure has an impact on interprofessional collaboration”; “The public health nurse is an important, but not always self‐evident, partner in interprofessional collaboration”; and “The primary players are the teachers in collaboration.” 
 
Conclusion 
The public health nurses describe that they had limited impact on collaboration and were dependent on both the school principal and the teachers for achieving good collaboration. Teachers have the power to decide whether to collaborate with the public health nurse, and public health nurses regard teachers as the most important collaborative partners. The public health nurses need to make themselves and their competence visible. 
 
Relevance to clinical practice 
The findings demonstrated that public health nurses are important collaborators, but are not always included in interprofessional collaboration. This knowledge is essential to strengthen public health nurses' roles and presence in schools, which could most certainly benefit adolescents with mental health problems in secondary school.
