    <h1>About</h1>
    Lyngroth and Gammelsæter conducted a study to understand the daily stress experienced by people with visual impairments and how mindfulness training (MT) helps them cope. They interviewed six individuals after an 8-week MT course. The study identified three main stress areas: lack of access to information, social expectations, and navigating physical spaces. Participants used MT to develop strategies like focusing on breathing, reflecting on thoughts and feelings, believing tasks are manageable, approaching situations differently, and avoiding rushing. These techniques helped them manage stress in all identified areas. The authors suggest that MT could be beneficial for stress management in visually impaired individuals, but more research is needed to confirm its health benefits.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The aim of this study was to explore what persons with visual impairment (VI) experienced as stressful in their daily lives and their experiences with using mindfulness training (MT) to cope with stressful situations. In order to explore this we conducted semi-structured interviews with six persons with VI after finishing an 8-week MT course. Systematic text condensation was used to analyze the interviews. This qualitative study found that the participants described three main areas of stress: (1) lack of access to information, (2) social expectations, and (3) navigating the body through one’s surroundings. The participants’ experiences with using MT to cope with stressful situations resulted in emotion-based and problem-based strategies: (1) breathing anchor, (2) awareness of and reflection upon thoughts and feelings, (3) most things are doable, (4) tackling the situation in a new way, and (5) haste makes waste. Our respondents described using MT for coping with stressful situations in all the three main areas of stress. Based upon this study we propose that there is good reason to offer MT as stress management for persons with VI, but further study is required to confirm the health-promoting benefits of MT for this group.
