    <h1>About</h1>
    Erdvik et al. conducted a study examining how physical education (PE) impacts adolescents' self-worth, which is crucial for their healthy development and learning. They focused on 2,854 Norwegian adolescents aged 13 to 16, exploring how satisfaction of basic psychological needs in PE influences their overall self-worth. The study found that when adolescents feel their basic needs are met in PE, their self-worth improves. However, those who don't engage in sports outside of school report lower satisfaction in PE, potentially hindering their self-worth development. This suggests that sports-active youth benefit more from PE, highlighting a disparity in educational outcomes. The findings raise concerns about equal education, as PE may not equally support all students' self-worth development.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Global self-worth is important for healthy development and learning, and is therefore highlighted as a major aim in the Norwegian physical education (PE) curriculum. Based on prior research this study aimed to assess potential differences in global self-worth and contextual basic need satisfaction among 2854 adolescents (47.5% boys, 52.5% girls, ages 13 and 16) participating in different movement contexts, and to determine whether basic need satisfaction in PE relates to global self-worth. Structural equation modeling analyses indicate that basic need satisfaction in PE relates significantly to global self-worth. However, adolescents who do not participate in movement contexts outside school report significantly lower basic need satisfaction in PE compared to their sports-active peers, and could possibly therefore experience reduced global self-worth development through PE. Findings support research showing that sports active youth reap most of the beneﬁts of PE, and thus, that PE violates the principles of equal education.
