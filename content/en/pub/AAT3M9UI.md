    <h1>About</h1>
    Mikaelsen et al. studied how weight loss affects magnesium levels in obese patients, both with and without diabetes. They found that 11% of the participants had severe magnesium deficiency at the start. Diabetic patients had lower magnesium levels compared to non-diabetic patients. After losing 10 kg through diet and bariatric surgery, both groups showed a 5% increase in magnesium levels. For non-diabetic patients, magnesium levels stabilized, while diabetic patients continued to see increases after surgery. Six months post-surgery, there was no significant difference in magnesium levels between the two groups. This is important because even small increases in magnesium can reduce the risk of heart disease, highlighting the health benefits of weight loss for obese individuals.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Serum magnesium (Mg) is reported to be reduced in individuals with obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus and has been suggested as a marker for metabolic syndrome. We have studied changes in serum Mg concentrations in a group of obese patients (n = 92) with and without diabetes mellitus after weight loss induced by dieting and bariatric surgery. At inclusion, 11% (10/92) of the population had severe Mg deficiency (< 0.75 mmol/L) and median serum Mg was lower in diabetic (n = 20) compared to non-diabetic (n = 72) patients (p = 0.002). A weight loss of 10 kg after 8 weeks of lifestyle interventions was accompanied by increased serum Mg of about 5% in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Serum Mg remained stable thereafter in the non-diabetic patients, while it continued to increase in the diabetic patients after bariatric surgery. Six months after bariatric surgery, there was no significant difference in serum Mg concentration between the groups (p = 0.08). The optimal range of circulating Mg concentration is not known, but as even small increments in serum Mg are reported to lower the risk of cardiovascular and ischemic heart disease, our results are interesting in a public health perspective.
