    <h1>About</h1>
    Visnes Trå et al. conducted two studies on Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS), a personality trait involving strong emotional responses, deep thinking, and empathy. In the first study, they examined the structure of the Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) scale and found three main factors: emotional reactivity and avoidance, sensory discomfort, and sensitivity to aesthetics and social cues. Women scored higher on all HSP factors compared to men. The second study compared personality traits between highly sensitive and less sensitive individuals. Highly sensitive people scored higher in neuroticism, agreeableness, and openness, but lower in conscientiousness, with no difference in extraversion. These findings help understand how sensitivity affects personality and can inform approaches to support highly sensitive individuals.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS) is a heritable personality related trait which includes 
sensitivity to a variety of stimuli, emotional, cognitive, and behavioural reactions such as 
strong positive and negative emotional responses, deep cognitive processing of stimuli, and 
empathic behaviour. Two studies are reported. Study 1 investigated the factor structure of 
the Highly Sensitive Person scale (HSP) and gender differences in HSP. Study 2 described 
differences in Big Five personality traits between two HSP groups. Study 1 comprised a 
sample of adults, mostly university students, matched on gender (N men = 548, N women 
= 548; total N = 1096). Study 2 was based on a sample consisting of a High (N = 164) and 
Low (N = 164) HSP group also matched on gender (N men = 82 and N women = 82 in 
both groups; total N = 328). There were no age differences between men and women in 
the two samples. Results from Study 1 showed a correlated three-factor solution: The first 
factor reflected excitability, easily aroused, negative emotional reactivity, frustration, 
avoidance of upsetting situations and childhood shyness. Factor 2 comprised low sensory 
threshold and sensory discomfort. Factor 3 captured intensity of aesthetic reactions, 
preoccupation with details in the environment, and socio-emotional sensitivity. Gender 
differences were found, women had elevated HSP scores on all scales, also when controlled 
for personality traits. Study 2 showed that the highly sensitive individuals had a unique 
personality trait profile compared to low sensitives. They had higher scores on neuroticism, 
agreeableness, openness, and lower scores on conscientiousness. There were no differences 
in extraversion i.e., there was no tendency towards introversion among the high sensitives.
