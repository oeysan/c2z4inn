    <h1>About</h1>
    Jin et al. studied how the transparency of a company, known as information asymmetry, affects its ability to adjust its debt levels. Using data from Chinese firms, they found that companies with higher information asymmetry face more difficulties in adjusting their debt-to-asset ratios. This slower adjustment can lead to poorer performance in terms of value, profitability, investment, and costs. By examining how quickly firms move towards their target debt levels, the authors showed that those who adjust faster tend to perform better overall. This research highlights the importance of transparency for companies, as it can significantly impact their financial health and operational success.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Information asymmetry reflects the risk and uncertainty faced by investors and is a measure of a firm's transparency. High information asymmetry could increase the cost of external financing, which in turn impedes a firm's leverage (debt–asset ratio) adjustment. The paper studies the adjustment speed towards the target leverage in the presence of information asymmetry by using microlevel data from China. In contrast with previous studies, we allow heterogeneity in the adjustment speed coefficient by modelling it as a non‐parametric function of information asymmetry and other firm characteristics. This refinement not only allows for more flexibility in the model, but it also facilitates further exploration into the differences and determinants of firms’ financing behaviour. We uniquely build the firm level measure of information asymmetry into the traditional partial leverage adjustment framework. Based on our firm level measure of the adjustment speed, our paper explores why the leverage adjustment speed matters by examining its association with corporate performance indicators. We find that China's firms do have leverage targets and they slowly adjust towards these targets. We also find that the adjustment speed decreases with an increase in information asymmetry. Overall, firms which converge towards their targets faster perform better in value, profitability, investment and costs.
