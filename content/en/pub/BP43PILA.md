    <h1>About</h1>
    Tolgfors et al. conducted a study in Sweden to understand how physical education teacher education (PETE) influences new PE teachers. They followed one teacher's journey from his training to his first teaching job, focusing on his use of "assessment for learning" (AfL), a method that helps teachers understand and improve student learning. The study found that positive experiences with AfL during training helped the teacher use it effectively in his job. This suggests that good teacher education can prepare new teachers to handle the challenges of their first teaching positions. The study highlights the importance of practical training and reflection in teacher education, showing that it can make a real difference in how teachers perform and adapt in their early careers.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    As part of a longitudinal research project on the transition from physical education teacher education (PETE) to school physical education (PE) in Sweden and exploring whether and how PETE matters, this article uses narrative inquiry to ‘represent’ a PE teacher’s professional journey from PETE to the induction phase of PE teaching. The study focuses on his use of, and reflections on, ‘assessment for learning’ (AfL) at different stages of his teaching experience. The purpose of the study is to contribute knowledge about how positive experiences of AfL during PETE can enable the use of AfL in school PE for a newly qualified teacher. This is done by analysing one male PETE student’s reflections on AfL in the context of a campus-based course on PE assessment, his use of and reflections on AfL during his practicum, and in school PE as a newly qualified teacher. The data generation consisted of recordings of a PETE seminar, a stimulated recall interview with the participant during his final school placement, and two interviews with him in his role as a newly qualified PE teacher at two different schools. Through the PE teacher’s tale, we show how the campus-based course on PE assessment in PETE and the student teacher’s positive experience of using AfL during his practicum seem to have inspired him in his later positions. The results are discussed in relation to the perspective of occupational socialisation theory. This narrative inquiry suggests that PETE can make a difference for student teachers who are prepared to face the challenges of the induction phase of PE teaching and are able to navigate between the barriers that get in their way. We conclude the paper with some considerations regarding the study’s potential strength (trustworthiness), sharing (transferability) and service (usefulness).
