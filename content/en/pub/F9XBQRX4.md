    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    Background Alcohol dependence is common, yet highly undertreated. Smartphone applications (apps) have potential to enhance treatment accessibility and effectiveness, however evidence is limited, especially studies focussing on user experiences. The aim was to describe patient perceptions on the usability and acceptability of self-monitoring apps provided as treatment complement for alcohol dependence. Methods Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted through video or phone calls with 21 participants, recruited from a randomized controlled trial at a dependency clinic in Stockholm. The participants had used two specific apps for self-monitoring consumption (“Glasklart” and “iBAC”) during 12 wk prior to the interviews. Data was analyzed using Qualitative Content Analysis. Results Two domains were identified: 1) Smartphone applications as facilitators to treatment, and 2) Barriers to smartphone application use. Using apps within the treatment context was believed to increase the accuracy of the reported consumption. Participants became more aware of their alcohol problem and described the apps as reinforcers that could increase both the motivation to change and the focus on the problem and commitment to treatment. The apps were further described as helpful to control alcohol consumption. However, app usage was constrained by technical problems, unfit app-specific features and procedures, and alcohol-related shame and stigma. Discussion and Conclusions Self-monitoring alcohol apps have several beneficial features that can help assess, track, and control alcohol consumption, and improve communication with clinicians. The results indicate they can be useful complements to treatment for patients with alcohol dependence, but their use can be limited by different, foremost technical, issues. KEY POINT SUMMARY Smartphone applications for self-monitoring of alcohol consumption may help provide accurate data, increase consumption awareness, focus, motivation, and perceived control; Smartphone applications for self-monitoring of alcohol consumption are considered helpful complements to alcohol treatment; The use of smartphone applications for self-monitoring of alcohol consumption can be constrained by technical problems, and unfit app-specific features and procedures.
