    <h1>About</h1>
    Herstad's study examines how different industries benefit from hiring skilled workers from outside their own sectors. The research found that firms in low-tech manufacturing and technology-intensive services are open to hiring from related industries, which aligns with previous studies. However, high-tech manufacturing firms gain more from hiring within their own sector, while traditional professional services rely on skills from outside their industry. This suggests that the best sources of new ideas and skills vary by industry type. Understanding these patterns can help businesses make better hiring decisions and improve innovation. The study also offers insights for policymakers on how to support industry growth by considering the unique skill needs of different sectors.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Building on recent evolutionary thinking, this paper focuses on inter-industry differences in the receptiveness of firms to inflows of skills from different domains of the external economy. The empirical analysis of innovation performance finds that firms’ dependences on recruiting outside their own industry domains were inversely related to the vibrancy of knowledge dynamics within them. Moreover, inflow distances that are ‘optimal’ from the perspective of learning are closer to manufacturing firms’ own 
industry domains, than they are to the domains of services firms. As a result, only low-tech manufacturing and technology-intensive services firms exhibit the receptiveness to inflows from ‘related’ industries found in prior evolutionary research. Firms in high-tech manufacturing, by contrast, capture strong learning benefits from intra-sectoral mobility flows, whereas firms in traditional professional services depend on skills developed outside their own industry domains. Implications for the theory, empirics and policy relevance of evolutionary economic geography are discussed.
