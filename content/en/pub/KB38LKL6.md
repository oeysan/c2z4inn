    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    Workplace bullying is a taboo event which occursworldwide, although the prevalence varies significantlybetween and within countries. Nurses have beenregarded an occupational risk group for bullying at thework place. Bullying in health and social care contextsis sometimes reported as frequent and, other times, asnot occurring, which sparked our interest in mappingthe occurrence of bullying in the health and social caresystem in Sweden. Thus, the purpose of the study wasto examine the prevalence of bullying, and to discusscultural traditions and environmental factors that affectbullying in workplaces. The sample (n=2810) con-sisted of employees at inpatient wards at four hospitals,and employees at municipal eldercare wards in Swe-den. A questionnaire including NAQ-22 R was dis-tributed and subsequently analysed with descriptivestatistics using SPSS. The youngest group of respon-dents scored higher than the older groups. Using con-trasting estimates of bullying, the prevalence variedbetween 4.1 and 18.5%, with the lowest prevalence inregards to self-reported exposure. According to the cut-off scores, NAQ-22 R, 8.6% of the respondents wereoccasionally exposed to bullying while 2.3% were con-sidered to be victims of severe bullying. Work-relatednegative acts were more common than personal nega-tive acts. The variations in prevalence of bullying as aresult of contrasting estimation strategies are discussedfrom perspective of the ‘law of Jante’, the ‘tall poppysyndrome’ and shame. Bullying deteriorates the work-ing conditions which may have an impact on quality ofpatient care.
