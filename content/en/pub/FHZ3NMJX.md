    <h1>About</h1>
    Wang and Singhal studied an entertainment-education initiative in India called Main Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hoon (MKBKSH). This program used storytelling on TV, radio, and digital platforms to challenge traditional patriarchal views. It reached an impressive audience of 400 million people. A key feature was its interactive voice response (IVR) system, which allowed viewers to give feedback and engage with the content in real time. The authors analyzed 1.7 million calls from over 390,000 unique phone numbers, showing how the IVR system enabled women, youth, and marginalized groups to participate. This approach highlights the potential of simple, accessible technology to foster communication and social change, making it easier for underrepresented voices to be heard and involved.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In a world where development is unequal and dominant discourses are strident, communication strategies that both listen and speak to the needs and aspirations of the marginalized are few and far between. In this article, we investigated Main Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hoon (MKBKSH), an entertainment-education initiative in India that strategically utilized storytelling on television, radio and digital platforms to question and challenge hegemonic patriarchal discourses. In so doing, MKBKSH not only garnered a staggering audience of 400 million, it pioneered the use of an interactive voice response (IVR) system to invite feedback from diverse audience members and to track their engagement with the programme in real time. Our analysis documents 1.7 million calls from over 390,000 unique phone numbers. Given the high penetration of mobile telephony in India, and its uniquely invitational nature, the IVR system enabled women, youth and the less privileged, to access curated content, answer questions and share personal opinions and actions inspired by MKBKSH. The IVR’s simple user interface and purposive use – akin to the ‘voicebook’ of the have-nots – hold important implications for the design, implementation and evaluation of large-scale, real-time communication and social change interventions.
