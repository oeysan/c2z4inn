    <h1>About</h1>
    Borch and Heier's book explores the concept of hybrid threats, which are subtle, non-violent tactics used by aggressor states to destabilize liberal democracies. These threats can undermine political governance and social stability without engaging in traditional warfare. As geopolitical tensions rise, the authors investigate how states can protect their communities from these threats. They emphasize the importance of collaboration between politicians, government agencies, the private sector, and citizens to detect and reduce these threats effectively. By involving various sectors in threat-reduction policies, societies can build resilience against potential conflicts. This book is particularly relevant for students and professionals in security studies, hybrid warfare, defense studies, and International Relations, offering insights into modern crisis management strategies.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    "This book examines hybrid threats within the broader context of a security crisis in Europe. As geopolitical tensions increase and great power rivalries intensify, can states protect their communities? While conventional wars are fought, parallel battles take place by more subtle and non-violent means. This multi-disciplinary book examines how hybrid threats undermine political governance and social stability in liberal democracies, covering aggressors, targeted states and victimized communities. It seeks to address how aggressor states undermine liberal democracies under the threshold of conflict, and the role played by hybrid threats as aggressor states prepare for full-scale war. The chapters also explore how liberal democracies organize and interact to detect hybrid threats, arguing that, in order to increase resilience, politicians and government agencies must involve the private sector and citizens in threat-reduction policies. The analysis builds upon the latest research in the international crisis management literature. This book will be of interest to students of security studies, hybrid warfare, defence studies and International Relations, as well as professional practitioners"
