    <h1>About</h1>
    Drugli et al. conducted a study on Norwegian toddlers to compare their cortisol levels, a stress hormone, at home and in childcare. They found that toddlers had higher cortisol levels in childcare, especially if they spent long hours there, compared to when they were at home. This increase in cortisol during the day suggests that childcare environments may be more stressful for young children. The study included 112 children from 85 childcare centers, with saliva samples and observations taken 5-6 months after they started attending childcare. These findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of childcare on children's stress levels and may inform practices to create more supportive environments in childcare settings.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Meta-analytic evidence suggests that children have higher cortisol levels in childcare than at home. In the present study change of morning to mid-afternoon levels of cortisol was explored at home and in childcare in a Norwegian sample of toddlers. Further, analyses of associations between change of cortisol levels in childcare and child-, family-, and childcare factors were conducted. One hundred and twelve children attending 85 childcare centres were included in the present study. Saliva samples and observations in childcare were conducted 5–6 months after the children entered childcare. Linear mixed-model analyses revealed a statistical significant difference in change of cortisol levels during the day in childcare as compared at home. An increase in cortisol levels during the day was found among Norwegian toddlers in childcare, in particular for children with long hours in childcare, but not at home. Implications for practice are discussed.
