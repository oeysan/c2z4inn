    <h1>About</h1>
    Ellefsen et al. conducted a survey involving 293 music teachers from 239 Norwegian schools to understand what types of music activities students engage in during lessons. They found that students listen to, sing, play, and create a variety of music. Teachers with less formal music training tended to choose activities that allowed for broader student participation compared to their more specialized colleagues. This suggests that teachers with less formal training might be more inclusive in their approach, enabling more students to take part in music activities. These findings are important because they highlight how teacher qualifications can influence the inclusivity of music education, potentially affecting students' overall engagement and interest in music.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This article reports on a survey of Norwegian compulsory school musicteachers, in which 293 teachers from 239 schools participated. Inaddition to providing demographic information, the teachers wereasked what kinds of music their students listened to, sang, played, andcreated during lessons, and what activities this music was part of. Weexplore this material with respect to which forms of activities wereincluded and how they were distributed, how the activities were relatedto teacher characteristics, what forms of participation the activitiesallowed for, and how this participation relates to broader societalpatterns. Thefindings show that a broad palette of activities wasimplemented, but also that teachers with less formal competence inmusic chose activities that allowed for broader participation than theirmore musically specialised colleagues. Drawing on Bourdieu’s conceptof refraction, we interpret this as the latter being loyal to the logic ofthe artfield
