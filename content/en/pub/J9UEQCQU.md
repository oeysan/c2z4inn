    <h1>About</h1>
    Larsson et al. conducted a study to see how leadership courses based on the developmental leadership model affected leaders' behaviors over time. They assessed 59 leaders before, one month after, and six months after the courses, using self-ratings and ratings from at least three subordinates. They found a small increase in positive leadership behaviors and a significant decrease in negative behaviors, especially according to the subordinates' ratings. The study identified three distinct leader profiles, and the improvements were consistent across all profiles, regardless of initial ratings. This research suggests that such leadership courses can effectively enhance leadership behaviors, making leaders more effective and reducing negative behaviors in the workplace.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The aim was to evaluate effects of leadership courses based on the developmental leadership model at the leadership behavioral level. A longitudinal 
design was employed with assessments before, one and six months after the leadership courses. The sample consisted of 59 leaders who made self-ratings 
and were rated by at least three subordinates on each occasion. Leadership behaviors were measured with the Developmental Leadership Questionnaire 
(DLQ). A limited increase of favorable leadership behaviors and a signiﬁcant reduction of unfavorable leadership behaviors were found, particularly 
according to the subordinates’ ratings. A cluster analysis yielded three meaningful leader proﬁles and showed that this pattern was found in all three 
proﬁles, irrespective of how favorably they were rated before the onset of the intervention.
