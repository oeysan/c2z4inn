    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    Background:Outpatient commitment (OC) is a legal decision for compulsory mental health care when the pa-tient stays in his or her own home. Municipal health-care workers have a key role for patients with OC decision,but little is known about how the legislation system with OC works from the municipality's point of view.Method:The present study has a quantitative descriptive design using an electronic questionnaire sent to health-care workers in the municipalities that participated. The study included health-care workers from the mentalhealth services in two counties in Norway who have experience with psychosis and OC decisions.Results:There were 230 people who received the questionnaire. The sample consisted of various health pro-fessionals from both small and large municipalities.The results show which tasks they have in follow-up ofpatients in the municipalities.Conclusion:From the municipality's point of view, there are no significant differences in follow-up for patientswith or without an OC decision, apart from conversations about medication. An individual plan is rarely used tofacilitate follow-up, although this is the statutory right of patients with OC decisions. The health-care workerslack knowledge and education about the OC scheme. The cooperation between municipalities and the specialisthealth-care services is not clearly defined
