    <h1>About</h1>
    Larsson and Lindqvist have compiled a comprehensive handbook on military psychology in Sweden. This book explores various aspects of psychological care and research within the military, focusing on both clinical and organizational practices. Key topics include the psychological adjustment of service members before and after deployment, common issues like substance abuse, and strategies to promote well-being, such as sleep and resilience training. The authors also address important social issues like PTSD, sexual harassment, and suicide prevention. They highlight the use of psychology in selecting and assessing personnel for specialized roles and training clinicians to work with military communities. This handbook aims to help health professionals better understand and support military personnel, veterans, and their families.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This expert compendium surveys the current state of military psychology across the branches of service at the clinical, research, consulting, and organizational levels. Its practical focus examines psychological adjustment pre- and post-deployment, commonly-encountered conditions (e.g., substance abuse), and the promotion of well-being, sleep, mindfulness, and resilience training. Coverage pays particular attention to uses of psychology in selection and assessment of service personnel in specialized positions, and training concerns for clinicians and students choosing to work with the military community. Chapters also address topics of particular salience to a socially conscious military, including PTSD, sexual harassment and assault, women’s and LGBT issues, suicide prevention, and professional ethics. 
 Among the specific chapters topics covered: 
 ·         Military deployment psychology: psychologists in the forward environment. 
·         Stress and resilience in married military couples. 
·         Assessment and selection of high-risk operational personnel: processes, 
procedures, and underlying theoretical constructs. 
·         Understanding and addressing sexual harassment and sexual assault in the US    
military. 
·         Virtual reality applications for the assessment and treatment of PTSD. 
·         Plus international perspectives on military psychology from China, Australia, India, and more. 
  
Grounding its readers in up-to-date research and practice, Military Psychology will assist health psychologists, clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and clinical social workers in understanding and providing treatment for military populations, veterans, and their families, as well as military psychologists in leadership and consulting positions.
