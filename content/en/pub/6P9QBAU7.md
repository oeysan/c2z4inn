    <h1>About</h1>
    Almquist et al. studied a well-trained cyclist to understand how pregnancy and postpartum periods affect performance-related physiological and blood changes. They found that during pregnancy, the cyclist's power output and maximum aerobic power increased slightly, while peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) stayed the same despite increases in red blood cell volume and blood volume. After delivery, blood volume decreased but red blood cell volume remained higher than pre-pregnancy levels. VO2peak nearly returned to pre-pregnancy levels, and maximum aerobic power improved. This study suggests that endurance athletes can maintain and even improve certain performance metrics during pregnancy and postpartum with appropriate training adjustments. These findings help in understanding how pregnancy impacts athletic performance and can guide future research in this area.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Purpose: To describe the performance-related physiological and haematological changes in a well-trained cyclist (peak oxygen uptake, VO2peak: 54.9 ml min−1·kg−1) performing endurance training during pregnancy and postpartum. 
 
Methods: Training data was systemized by training form (endurance and resistance), intensity (low- (LIT), moderate-, and high-intensity training), and modality (cycling, running, hiking, XC-skiing, strength training and other). Power output at 4 mmol L−1 [BLa−] (L4), maximal aerobic power (Wmax), and VO2peak as well as haemoglobin mass, blood volume, plasma volume and red blood cell volume (RBCV) were measured at different time points during pregnancy and 12 weeks postpartum. 
 
Results: L4 and Wmax increased by 3% while absolute VO2peak was unaltered from gestational wk 2 to 14, despite 12 and 14% increases in RBCV and BV. After delivery, BV was reduced by 7% but RBCV was maintained 5% above start-pregnancy levels, while VO2peak almost returned to (-1%), and Wmax increased by 5% above start-pregnancy levels 12 weeks postpartum. 
 
Conclusion: This case-study illustrates a disassociation between increases in haematological values and VO2peak during pregnancy. Furthermore, a quick resumption of LIT and a gradually increasing intensity of training in the 12 weeks following delivery ensured a return to start-pregnancy levels of VO2peak and corresponding improvements in Wmax. Although general recommendations cannot be given on the basis of these data, this study provides a framework for investigating pregnant endurance athletes and contributes to the generation of new hypotheses in this field.
