    <h1>About</h1>
    Puijk's article examines the phenomenon of "slow TV" in Norway, where the public broadcaster NRK has created long, leisurely television programs that focus on traditional aspects of Norwegian identity. Despite their slow pace and lack of dramatic action, these shows have gained significant popularity, especially among older viewers. The programs showcase various regions of Norway, emphasizing natural landscapes and traditional values like rural living and "friluftsliv," which means enjoying outdoor life. However, urban areas and Norway's non-white population are notably missing from these representations. This study highlights how slow TV serves as a unique medium for reflecting and reinforcing a particular version of national identity, tapping into core cultural values that resonate with many Norwegians.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Since 2009, the Norwegian public service broadcaster NRK has produced a number of slow TV shows. Some of the programmes have had a surprisingly big success in terms of public engagement and audience share even though the majority of the audience was from the oldest age groups. These programmes are not only slow, lasting a long time and lacking dramatic development and progress, they also engage in a particular, traditional version of national identity. The current article argues that, through slow TV, the Norwegian public service broadcaster has found a new way to reflect a particular version of Norwegian identity and to tap into the central values of Norwegian culture. Taken together, the shows cover all regions of the country—the coastal areas as well the inlands and mountains. In terms of representation, the programmes highlight nature and traditional Norwegian values such as closeness to nature, rural life, and “friluftsliv” (living the outdoor life). Urban areas and the non-white population are conspicuously absent.
