    <h1>About</h1>
    Hracs et al. explore the complex world of the creative economy in their book by examining three main tensions: individual versus collaborative creativity, tradition versus innovation, and isolated versus interconnected creative spaces. These tensions highlight the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of creativity in today's economy. The authors provide insights into various creative practices and locations, such as co-working spaces in Berlin and rural Spain, and creative businesses in Leicester. They also discuss the role of cultural intermediaries in Africa and the impact of social media and crowdfunding. By focusing on these diverse aspects, the book helps readers understand how creativity is shaped by different factors and how it influences economic and cultural development globally.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This book nuances our understanding of the contemporary creative economy by engaging with a set of three key tensions which emerged over the course of eight European Colloquiums on Culture, Creativity and Economy (CCE): 1) the tension between individual and collaborative creative practices, 2) the tension between tradition and innovation, and 3) the tension between isolated and interconnected spaces of creativity. 
 
Rather than focusing on specific processes, such as production, industries or locations, the tensions acknowledge and engage with the messy and restless nature of the creative economy. Individual chapters offer insights into poorly understood practices, locations and contexts such as co-working spaces in Berlin and rural Spain, creative businesses in Leicester and the role and importance of cultural intermediaries in creative economies within Africa. Others examine the nature of trans-local cultural flows, the evolving "field" of fashion, and the implications of social media and crowdfunding platforms.
