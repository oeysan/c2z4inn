    <h1>About</h1>
    Čonč et al. conducted a study on Eurasian lynx to understand how these animals choose their habitats, focusing on small-scale features like rocky outcrops and rugged terrain. Using advanced technology like LiDAR (a method to map terrain using laser light), they discovered that lynx prefer steep, rocky areas for resting during the day. Interestingly, lynx avoid paths during the day but use them at night, showing how human infrastructure affects their behavior differently depending on the time. The study found that lynx are more likely to select rocky areas when these habitats are scarce, emphasizing the need to protect such terrains. This research suggests using remote sensing to better understand animal habitat choices and advises careful planning of human infrastructure near these natural features.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Context Many carnivores are attracted to rugged terrain, rocky areas, and conspicuous relief features. However, most of the previous research is limited to general topographical habitat characteristics and rarely consider the effects of microhabitat characteristics. Objectives We used the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) as a model species to investigate the effects of microhabitat characteristics and human infrastructure on habitat selection. We also tested whether there is evidence for a functional response in habitat selection across a large gradient of habitat availability. Methods We developed a new approach for detecting rocky outcrops from airborne LiDAR data. In combination with other remote sensing techniques and GPS-telemetry data, we assessed lynx habitat selection and functional responses across two geologically contrasting areas in Europe. Results We detected  1 million rocky outcrops and confirmed their strong selection by lynx. Lynx also selected steep, rugged, and rocky areas, especially for day-resting sites. Furthermore, lynx avoided paths during the day but selected them and other linear anthropogenic infrastructure during the night, indicating the behaviour-specific impact of human infrastructure. We also observed a functional response in the selection of rocky and rugged areas, as lynx’ selection of such habitats increased with their lower availability. This highlights the importance of preserving such terrains, especially when they are rare in a landscape. Conclusions Our results highlight the importance of incorporating remote sensing techniques and data on microhabitat features in animal habitat selection research. We also recommend caution when developing new infrastructure for human recreation or promoting its use near geomorphological features and in rugged terrain.
