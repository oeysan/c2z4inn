    <h1>About</h1>
    Tveit et al. conducted a study to see if the Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management program helps improve children's emotional, behavioral, and social skills by enhancing their relationship with teachers. They followed 1,085 children, around 4 years old, over time and compared those who participated in the program with those who did not. The researchers found that children in the program developed better relationships with their teachers. These improved relationships were linked to better emotional, behavioral, and social outcomes for the children. Essentially, the study suggests that improving how teachers interact with children can lead to significant positive changes in the children's overall development. This is important because it highlights a practical way to support children's growth in school settings.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This study examined whether, and the extent to which, the Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management program predicted positive development of children’s emotional, behavioral, and social adjustment through changes in the child–teacher relationship. Using data from a longitudinal quasi-experimental intervention trial with a matched control condition, including 1,085 children (49.7% girls, meanage = 4.22 years; SDage = 0.88 years), the potential associations were tested by means of multilevel path modeling. The mediation model demonstrated that (1) children in the intervention condition achieved more favorable changes in the child–teacher relationship than the control condition; (2) changes in the child–teacher relationship were associated with changes in the target outcomes; and (3) the intervention effects were mediated via changes in the child–teacher relationship.
