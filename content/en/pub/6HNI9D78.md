    <h1>About</h1>
    Gurdal et al. conducted a study to understand how adolescents perceive a treatment for problematic gaming and its impact on their relationship with their parents. They interviewed nine adolescents who had completed the treatment and analyzed the responses. The study found that the treatment helped adolescents gain control over their gaming habits, with therapists playing a crucial role. Most participants reported that the treatment made them more aware of how gaming affected other aspects of their lives. Additionally, the treatment improved their relationships with their parents by reducing daily conflicts. These findings are important for developing future interventions to help young people manage problematic gaming and improve family dynamics.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Given the increasing prevalence of problematic gaming, in 2013, the diagnosis “Internet gaming disorder (IGD)” was included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) as a potential diagnosis. With a new diagnosis, it is important to determine treatment options. The importance of the parent–child relationship has been emphasized in problematic gaming and its treatment. This study aims to provide more knowledge about adolescents’ perceptions of a treatment for problematic gaming and understand whether such treatment may have a bearing on the parent–child relationship. We conducted individual interviews with nine adolescents who completed a treatment for problematic gaming. The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. The analysis revealed three themes. Theme 1: adolescents’ experiences of the new treatment; Theme 2: adolescents’ perceptions of the effect of the treatment on their gaming behaviour; and Theme 3: adolescents’ perceptions of changes in their parent–child relationships. The adolescents viewed the treatment as a way of gaining control of their gaming, a process in which a therapist played an integral part. For the majority of the adolescents in our study, the main effects of treatment 
were gaining insight into how their gaming and gaming-related behaviours affected other parts of their lives. The participants felt that the treatment improved their relationship with their parents through reducing everyday conflicts. This new knowledge can be used for the development of future interventions involving children and adolescents.
