    <h1>About</h1>
    Molinari-Jobin et al. studied the rehabilitation and release of orphaned Eurasian lynx in Europe to understand its impact on conservation. They collected data on 320 orphaned lynx from 13 countries over 47 years. They found that 55% of these lynx were taken to rehabilitation centers, and 66 were released back into the wild. Of those released, 66% survived at least one year, and ten reproduced. The study suggests that releasing rehabilitated lynx can help manage genetic diversity and reintroduce the species to historical habitats. The authors recommend releasing orphans at the edges of their distribution or as part of reintroduction projects to maximize conservation benefits. This approach can support the long-term health and genetic diversity of lynx populations in Europe.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Rehabilitation of injured or immature individuals has become an increasingly used conservation and management tool. However, scientific evaluation of rehabilitations is rare, raising concern about post-release welfare as well as the cost-effectiveness of spending scarce financial resources. Over the past 20 years, events of juvenile Eurasian lynx presumably orphaned have been observed in many European lynx populations. To guide the management of orphaned lynx, we documented survival, rehabilitation and fate after the release and evaluated the potential relevance of lynx orphan rehabilitation for population management and conservation implications. Data on 320 orphaned lynx was collected from 1975 to 2022 from 13 countries and nine populations. The majority of orphaned lynx (55%) were taken to rehabilitation centres or other enclosures. A total of 66 orphans were released back to nature. The portion of rehabilitated lynx who survived at least one year after release was 0.66. Release location was the best predictor for their survival. Of the 66 released lynx, ten have reproduced at least once (8 females and 2 males). Conservation implications of rehabilitation programmes include managing genetic diversity in small, isolated populations and reintroducing species to historical habitats. The lynx is a perfect model species as most reintroduced populations in Central Europe show significantly lower observed heterozygosity than most of the autochthonous populations, indicating that reintroduction bottlenecks, isolation and post-release management have long-term consequences on the genetic composition of populations. The release of translocated orphans could be a valuable contribution to Eurasian lynx conservation in Europe. It is recommended to release orphans at the distribution edge or in the frame of reintroduction projects instead of a release in the core area of a population where it is not necessary from a demographic and genetic point of view. Rehabilitation programmes can have conservation implications that extend far beyond individual welfare benefits.
