    <h1>About</h1>
    Oliveira et al. conducted a study to improve the accuracy of identifying kill sites of Eurasian lynx using GPS data. They found that reducing the number of GPS fixes (location points) from seven to three per night still allowed them to detect most ungulate (large animal) kills, but it made it harder to identify kills of smaller or domestic prey. They used a machine learning method called random forest to classify kill sites and found it was effective for large prey but less accurate for small prey. The study suggests that researchers should be cautious when studying areas with domestic prey, as kill rates might be underestimated. These findings help improve methods for tracking predator impacts on different prey species, which is important for wildlife conservation.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Kill rates are a central parameter to assess the impact of predation on preyspecies. An accurate estimation of kill rates requires a correct identificationof kill sites, often achieved by field-checking GPS location clusters (GLCs).However, there are potential sources of error included in kill-site identifica-tion, such as failing to detect GLCs that are kill sites, and misclassifying thegenerated GLCs (e.g., kill for nonkill) that were not field checked. Here, weaddress these two sources of error using a large GPS dataset of collared Eur-asian lynx (Lynx lynx), an apex predator of conservation concern in Europe, inthree multiprey systems, with different combinations of wild, semidomestic,and domestic prey. We first used a subsampling approach to investigate howdifferent GPS-fix schedules affected the detection of GLC-indicated kill sites.Then, we evaluated the potential of the random forest algorithm to classifyGLCs as nonkills, small prey kills, and ungulate kills. We show that thenumber of fixes can be reduced from seven to three fixes per night withoutmissing more than 5% of the ungulate kills, in a system composed of wild prey.Reducing the number of fixes per 24 h decreased the probability of detectingGLCs connected with kill sites, particularly those of semidomestic or domesticprey, and small prey. Random forest successfully predicted between 73%–90%of ungulate kills, but failed to classify most small prey in all systems, withsensitivity  (true  positive  rate)  lower  than  65%.  Additionally,  removingdomestic prey improved the algorithm’s overall accuracy. We provide a setof recommendations for studies focusing on kill-site detection that can beconsidered for other large carnivore species in addition to the Eurasian lynx.We recommend caution when working in systems including domestic prey,as the odds of underestimating kill rates are higher.domestic prey, Eurasian lynx, GPS location clusters (GLCs), GPS-fix schedule, kill sites,multiprey system, random forest
