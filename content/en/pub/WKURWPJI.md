    <h1>About</h1>
    Holm et al. conducted a study on police leadership education, focusing on a digital course designed to enhance police leaders' skills. They explored how the online format of the course impacted students' learning and how the acquired knowledge was applied 1.5 years after completion. The study involved 24 students who participated in a 12-week course, starting with a two-day on-site introduction followed by online instruction. Data was collected through surveys and interviews. The findings revealed that participants felt more competent as police leaders, better at connecting theory with practice, and more confident in their roles. Additionally, they improved their digital skills and shared their new knowledge with colleagues. This suggests that digital education can effectively support police leadership development by integrating personal and organizational growth.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Police leadership is an essential part of policing, as is the education of police leaders. Our study responds to the call for research on how to transform police leadership education into practice. In this longitudinal mixed-methods single case study we investigate two research questions: 1) How do the digital didactics of the digital police leadership course contribute to students’ perceived learning? 2) How are the knowledge and skills acquired in the digital police leadership course perceived to be applied 1.5 years after course completion? 
We collected data from students enrolled in a 12-week course. This course offered 24 students a two-day on-site course introduction, while the rest of the course was taught online. Data was collected through five surveys and follow-up interviews with six partic- ipants. The results show that police leaders perceived increased competence in being a police leader, report enhanced ability to bridge theory and practice, and improved their dig- ital skills. They also reported increased confidence in the leadership role and increased sharing of competence after study completion. The findings suggest that digital didactics may achieve embedded police education as it can provide an interplay of individual and organizational factors.
