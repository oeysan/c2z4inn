    <h1>About</h1>
    Larsson et al. conducted a study on 173 young male Lithuanian conscripts to understand how personality and cognitive appraisal styles relate to stress indicators in the body. They used hair samples to measure levels of cortisol, cortisone, and testosterone, which are hormones linked to stress. The researchers identified four distinct personality profiles and found that those with high scores in Extraversion and Openness but low in Agreeableness had the highest levels of stress hormones. Additionally, three cognitive appraisal styles were identified, but these did not correlate with hormone levels. The study suggests that psychological assessments can help identify individuals who are more vulnerable to stress, which could be useful for monitoring and support in high-stress environments like military training.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The aim was to: (1) identify individual profiles in young men regarding personality and cognitive 
appraisal style employing easy-to-use instruments, and (2) to explore how such profiles relate to 
biological stress indicators. The sample consisted of 173 male Lithuanian conscripts. An 
assessment was made after one month into their basic military training. Levels of cortisol, 
cortisone and testosterone were established through analysis of hair samples. Psychological 
assessments included the Big Five model of personality as well as cognitive appraisal style and 
perceived stress during the previous month of service. Four unique personality profiles were 
identified in a cluster analysis that differed significantly as theoretically expected on the 
Perceived Stress Scale. Statistically significant between-profile differences were found on cortisol 
and cortisone but not on testosterone. The personality profile with the highest scores on all 
three biological markers was characterized by high scores on Extraversion and Openness and 
low scores on Agreeableness. Second, three distinct cognitive appraisal style profiles emerged. 
They were related as theoretically expected to perceived stress, but they were unrelated to the 
hair steroid hormone concentration levels. Third, the combination of the most psychologically 
vulnerable personality profile, which included low scores on Emotional stability, and the most 
stressed cognitive appraisal style profile, yielded the clearest result and showed that it was 
possible to detect individuals with significantly higher stress-related hair steroid hormone levels 
using psychological instruments. Practical potential implications include identification of 
individuals who are most psychologically vulnerable and in need of close monitoring.
