    <h1>About</h1>
    Salvatori et al. studied how red and roe deer use forests differently during the day and night. They used two types of geographic data, Tree Cover Density (TCD) and Corine Land Cover (CLC), to track the deer's movements. They found that about 20% of the GPS data showed inconsistencies between the two data types, especially in smaller areas. Despite this, both data types showed similar overall proportions of forest and open habitats. The study revealed that both deer species prefer forests during the day more than at night, with TCD showing this pattern more clearly than CLC. The authors suggest that choosing the right geographic data is crucial for accurately studying animal habitats, especially when using GPS data.

    Context  
Diel use of forest and open habitats by large herbivores is linked to species-specifc needs of multiple and heterogeneous resources. However, forest cover layers might deviate considerably for a given landscape, potentially afecting evaluations of animals’ habitat use. 
Objectives We assessed inconsistency in the estimates of diel forest use by red and roe deer at GPS location and home range (HR) levels, using two geographic layers: Tree Cover Density (TCD) and Corine Land Cover (CLC). 
Methods We frst measured the classifcation mismatch of red and roe deer GPS locations between TCD and CLC, also with respect to habitat units’ size. Then, we used Generalised Least Squares models to assess the proportional use of forest at day and night at the GPS location and HR levels, both with TCD and CLC. 
Results About 20% of the GPS locations were inconsistently classifed as forest or open habitat by the two layers, particularly within smaller habitat units. Overall proportion of forest and open habitat, though, was very similar for both layers. In all populations, both deer species used forest more at day than at night and this pattern was more evident with TCD than with CLC. However, at the HR level, forest use estimates were only marginally diferent between the 
two layers. 
Conclusions When estimating animal habitat use, geographic layer choice requires careful evaluation with respect to ecological questions and target species. Habitat use analyses based on GPS locations are more sensitive to layer choice than those based on home ranges.
