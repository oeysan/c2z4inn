    <h1>About</h1>
    The authors conducted an experimental study to explore the relationship between postural stability and cybersickness in virtual reality (VR). They tested 50 healthy adults by measuring their postural stability before, during, and after watching VR videos. They found that participants who experienced cybersickness showed more significant deterioration in postural stability during the first minute of VR exposure compared to those who did not. However, there was considerable individual variation, and the differences were not consistent across all measures. The study suggests that while postural stability changes can indicate cybersickness at a group level, they are not reliable predictors or objective measures for individuals due to the variability. This highlights the complex nature of how cybersickness and postural stability are related.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Virtual reality (VR) is known to cause cybersickness, and studies report that deteriorations of postural stability 
coincides with the onset cybersickness. It is unclear whether these deteriorations are the cause or a consequence 
of cybersickness. Thus, it is also unclear whether measures of postural stability may either predict susceptibility 
(cause) or objectively measure (consequence) the malaise. To examine whether deteriorations of postural stability can either predict or objectively measure cybersickness, healthy active adults (n = 50) were exposed to one 
of two different 10 min 360˚VR videos. Postural stability was assessed, using a force platform, before exposure 
with eyes open (baseline) and eyes closed, during the first and last minute of exposure, and approximately 10 min 
after exposure. The deterioration of postural stability from baseline to the first minute of exposure was larger in 
participants who reported cybersickness, compared to those who did not, for both total trace length (p = 0.017) 
and standard deviation velocity (p = 0.008). However, there was substantial individual variation and overlap 
between sick and well participants. Deteriorations of postural stability from baseline to the eyes closed condition 
did not differ between sick and well participants (trace length, p = 0.270; standard deviation velocity, p = 
0.112). There was a significant correlation between the severity of cybersickness and the change of postural 
stability from the first to the last minute of VR exposure for trace length (rs=0.32, p = 0.027), but not standard 
deviation velocity (rs=0.20, p = 0.187). The deteriorations had returned to baseline levels 10 min after exposure. 
These findings suggest that deteriorations of postural stability was both a predictor and objective measure at a 
group level. However, the large individual variation, substantial overlap between sick and well participants, and 
the limited strength of correlations suggest that deterioration of postural stability has limited practical value as 
both a predictor and objective measure. These findings emphasize the complicated nature of the relationship 
between cybersickness and postural stability.
