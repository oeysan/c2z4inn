    <h1>About</h1>
    Vickers et al. developed a new method to gather scientists' opinions worldwide. They created a network where local coordinators at various institutions send out brief surveys via email. These surveys ask scientists to rate their agreement with a statement using a five-point scale. In June 2023, they tested this method by asking 20,085 scientists from 30 institutions in 12 countries if they agreed that COVID-19 is caused by a virus. They received 6,807 responses, showing that this approach can quickly and effectively collect scientific opinions globally. This method could help inform policy decisions and improve public understanding by providing up-to-date insights from the scientific community.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    We take up the challenge of developing an international network with capacity to survey the world’s scientists on an ongoing basis, providing rich datasets regarding the opinions of scientists and scientific sub-communities, both at a time and also over time. The novel methodology employed sees local coordinators, at each institution in the network, sending survey invitation emails internally to scientists at their home institution. The emails link to a ‘10 second survey’, where the participant is presented with a single statement to consider, and a standard five-point Likert scale. In June 2023, a group of 30 philosophers and social scientists invited 20,085 scientists across 30 institutions in 12 countries to participate, gathering 6,807 responses to the statement Science has put it beyond reasonable doubt that COVID-19 is caused by a virus. The study demonstrates that it is possible to establish a global network to quickly ascertain scientific opinion on a large international scale, with high response rate, low opt-out rate, and in a way that allows for significant (perhaps indefinite) repeatability. Measuring scientific opinion in this new way would be a valuable complement to currently available approaches, potentially informing policy decisions and public understanding across diverse fields.
