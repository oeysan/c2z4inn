    <h1>About</h1>
    Horsfjord published a document in October 2007 called "A Common Word Between Us and You," which was created by various Muslim leaders and scholars. This document emphasized the importance of loving God and one's neighbor and invited Christian leaders to join in dialogue. Many Christian leaders accepted this invitation, leading to numerous Muslim-Christian conferences and cooperative projects worldwide. These efforts included Christians from different denominations, such as Orthodox and Evangelicals. The initiative has fostered interreligious cooperation beyond just Muslim-Christian relations and has the potential to continue promoting unity and collaboration in the future.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The document A Common Word Between Us and You was published by a 
broad range of Muslim leaders and scholars in October 2007. Focussing 
on the twin commandment to love God and neighbour, it invited Christian 
leaders to engage in dialogue. Many Church leaders eagerly embraced the 
invitation, and in the subsequent years, the Muslim initiative bore fruits 
in the form of numerous Muslim-Christian conferences and cooperative 
projects across the world involving a broad range of Christians from 
Orthodox to Evangelicals. It has inspired interreligious cooperation 
beyond the Muslim-Christian axis and can continue to do so in the years 
to come.
