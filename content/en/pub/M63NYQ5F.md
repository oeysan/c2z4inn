    <h1>About</h1>
    Ripari et al. conducted a study on the habitat selection of Eurasian lynx across Europe, focusing on how human disturbances affect their choices. They analyzed data from 125 lynx in 9 different locations, using a method that compared areas lynx used with those available to them. They found that lynx tend to avoid roads and human settlements at a larger landscape scale, while at a smaller home-range scale, they prefer areas with natural features that offer shelter and abundant prey. The study suggests that lynx need diverse forests and protection from human disturbances. These findings are important for conservation efforts, helping to understand how to protect lynx in areas heavily influenced by human activity.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Habitat selection is a multi-scale process driven by trade-offs between benefits, such as resource abundance, and disadvantages, such as the avoidance of risk. The latter includes human disturbances, to which large carnivores, with their large spatial requirements, are especially sensitive. We investigated the ecological processes underlying multi-scale habitat selection of a large carnivore, namely Eurasian lynx, across European landscapes characterized by different levels of human modification. Using a unique dataset of 125 lynx from 9 study sites across Europe, we compared used and available locations within landscape and home-range scales using a novel Mixed Effect randomForest approach, while considering environmental predictors as proxies for human disturbances and environmental resources. At the landscape scale, lynx avoided roads and human settlements, while at the home-range scale natural landscape features associated with shelter and prey abundance were more important. The results showed sex was of relatively low variable importance for lynx's general habitat selection behaviour. We found increasingly homogeneous responses across study sites with finer selection scales, suggesting that study site differences determined coarse selection, while utilization of resources at the finer selection scale was broadly universal. Thereby describing lynx's requirement, if not preference, for heterogeneous forests and shelter from human disturbances and implying that regional differences in coarse-scale selection are driven by availability rather than preference. These results provide crucial information for conserving this species in human-dominated landscapes, as well as for the first time, to our knowledge, generalising habitat selection behaviour of a large carnivore species at a continental scale.
