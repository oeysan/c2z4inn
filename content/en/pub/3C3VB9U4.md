    <h1>About</h1>
    Olsen provides an overview of key sustainability concepts and regulations relevant to business education, research, and digital business practices. They focus on the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework, Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs), and Sustainable Enterprise Resource Planning (S ERP) systems. The paper examines these topics from theoretical, regulatory, and digital perspectives, aiming to help professors, business practitioners, and researchers understand and integrate sustainability into their work. This study is important because it bridges the gap between sustainability theory and practical application, making it easier for businesses to comply with new EU regulations and promote sustainable practices. By doing so, it supports the development of more environmentally and socially responsible business strategies.

The aim of this paper is to provide an overview on key sustainability concepts, such as, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) framework, Sustainability Developments Goals (SDGs), the recent regulatory requirements and S ERP. To do this, the paper provides the overview through three perspectives: theoretical, regulatory and digital. This overview is a first step to elucidate the sustainability key concepts when professors communicate with business students, when business practitioners communicate with their clients and when business researchers seek for relevant sustainability theories, regulations and S ERP related knowledge for their future business research. The novelty of this paper is seamlessly presenting fundamental sustainability concepts going from theory to practical digital implementation for businesses.
