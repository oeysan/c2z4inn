    <h1>About</h1>
    Andersson et al. conducted a study to understand how nursing staff and older people perceive the human aspects of oral care quality in short-term and intensive care units. They used questionnaires and clinical assessments to gather data from 417 nursing staff and 74 older people between 2013 and 2016. The study found that nursing staff's views on the importance of humanity in oral care were influenced by their gender, work role, and care environment. In contrast, older people's perceptions were linked to their physical health. Overall, nursing staff in short-term care units valued the human aspects of oral care more highly than the older people in those units. This research highlights the need for healthcare providers to consider personal and environmental factors when delivering oral care.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Aim 
(a) To describe and compare perceptions of humanity aspects of oral care quality in relation to nursing staff in short‐term care units and intensive care units and older people in short‐term care units and their person‐related conditions; and (b) to compare humanity aspects of oral care quality perceptions between nursing staff and older people in short‐term care units. 
 
Design 
Cross‐sectional study. Self‐reported questionnaire and clinical assessments. 
 
Methods 
Nursing staff (N = 417) and older people (N = 74) completed the modified Quality of Care from a Patient Perspective instrument and person‐related items. Older people's oral health status was clinically assessed using the Revised Oral Assessment Guide. Data were analysed using descriptive and analytic statistics. The data were collected from 2013–2016. 
 
Results 
Nursing staff's perceptions of humanity aspects of oral care quality were related to gender, work role and care environment. Older people's perceptions of humanity aspects of oral care quality were related to self‐reported physical health. Nursing staff in short‐term care units perceived the subjective importance of humanity aspects of oral care quality higher compared with older people in short‐term care units.
