    <h1>About</h1>
    Wheeler and Green conducted a study examining how middle-class parents in northern England view and manage their children's organized activities, such as sports and clubs. Through interviews with 48 families, they found that these activities are seen as a key part of "good" parenting. This trend is influenced by societal changes over the past 30 years, including more mothers working, a competitive job market, and concerns about children's health and safety. These factors lead parents to carefully plan and invest in their children's leisure activities, aiming to enhance their development and future opportunities. Understanding this helps explain how parenting practices evolve with societal shifts, impacting family life and children's experiences.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Class-related parenting cultures and ideologies have been of considerable interest to academics over the last two decades. Much of the research thus far has focused on exploring Annette Lareau's conceptualisations of ‘natural growth’ and ‘concerted cultivation’ and the implications for outcomes in relation to education. The focus of the present article is organised activities, which are a central but as yet relatively under-researched feature of middle-class parenting. The findings are based upon 73 semi-structured interviews with parents and children from 48 middle-class families living in and around a small city in northern England. The article reveals that initiating and facilitating children's organised activities is considered a central aspect of ‘good’ parenting in middle-class social networks. It is shown how this is a consequence of several developments within society over the past three decades or so, including the rising levels of maternal employment, the growing competitiveness of the labour market and the increasing concerns related to children's health and safety. It is argued that these developments have heightened middle-class parents’ predisposition to not only be involved with and invest in their children's leisure biographies, but to do so in a more deliberate, rigorous and rational manner.
