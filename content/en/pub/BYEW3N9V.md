    <h1>About</h1>
    Vaktskjold conducted a study to understand how often teenagers in western Norway brush their teeth and what factors influence this habit. They found that 69% of the 8,725 students surveyed brushed their teeth more than once a day, with girls brushing more frequently than boys. Specifically, 76% of girls and 63% of boys brushed more than once daily. The study also revealed that older students (grades 11-13) brushed less frequently than younger ones (grades 8-10). Factors like regular physical exercise, parental awareness of their child's activities, and overall health satisfaction were linked to more frequent tooth brushing. This research highlights the importance of promoting good dental hygiene and its connection to general health among adolescents.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Dental caries is the most prevalent disease in Norway and worldwide, and daily tooth brushing with fluoridated toothpaste is the main preventative measure when diets contain sugary foods. Tooth brushing is an 
important public health indicator, as the frequency of brushing also has been positively associated with good 
health in general. In Norway, brushing twice a day is the official recommendation. Our aim was to assess the 
frequency of tooth brushing among pupils in secondary school in two counties in western Norway, and to 
identify factors associated with brushing more than once a day. All 59 borough administrations in the two 
counties were invited to participate in the Ungdata survey in 2015-16; 26 agreed. In total 8,725 pupils filled 
in the electronic questionnaire (82%). Some 69% brushed their teeth more frequently than once a day, 
specifically 76% of whom were girls and 63% were boys (adjusted odds ratio=2.0). Of the boys, 6.5% did 
not brush daily. In 8-10th school grade 71% brushed more than once a day, compared to 65% in 11-13th grade. 
Out of 28 a priori selected factors, eight were independently associated with frequency of tooth brushing. 
Besides gender, the strongest associations observed were for frequency of brisk physical exercise, parents 
being informed about their adolescent’s whereabouts, and satisfaction with one’s own health.
