    <h1>About</h1>
    Ohlsson et al. conducted a study to understand how leadership influences the interaction between informal and formal structures within a military organization. By interviewing eleven high-level military officers, they identified key elements called "Organization Influencers," which include both "Shadow Factors" (informal elements) and "Formal Factors" (official elements). The study found that leaders face challenges in balancing these factors for the benefit of individuals, groups, and the organization as a whole. Contrary to previous beliefs that shadow organizations are negative, the research suggests that these informal elements can be positive if managed well. This insight is important because it shows that effective leadership can harness informal influences to improve organizational performance.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The study's aim was to elucidate the role played by leadership in the relationship between informal organizational influencers and the formal organization in a military context. A qualitative study was conducted by interviewing eleven high-level military officers and analyzing the data according to the grounded theory method. The analysis resulted in an identification of a core variable : Organization Influencers, which are composed of two sub-core variables (Shadow Factors and Formal Factors) that interact with one another. Therefore challenges arise for the leader to balance varying shadow and formal factors for individuals, groups and the organization. Previously research has defined the shadow organisation as a negative force ; however, our results indicate that this is not always the case. This study contributes by mapping out specific shadow factors in relationship with formal factors of a military organization, along with pointing out that shadow factors can be beneficial forces for organisations if balanced appropriately by the leader.
