    <h1>About</h1>
    Filstad et al. conducted a study on how police leaders in Norway learn to lead. They shadowed and interviewed 27 police leaders to understand their daily practices. The study found that these leaders primarily learn through hands-on experience within the police culture, rather than formal teaching. This suggests that learning by doing is crucial, but it can be random and not always effective. The authors highlight that the Norwegian police system focuses more on management skills than leadership development. They recommend combining management and leadership training to improve police leadership. Additionally, they emphasize the importance of creating a "manoeuvring space," or flexibility, for leaders to adapt and change established practices, which can enhance their learning and effectiveness.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This article examines how Norwegian police leaders learn to lead and what constitutes police practices. Twenty-seven police leaders were shadowed during and interviewed about their daily practices of policing. We found that police leaders learn foremost through their experiences by practising leadership within the context of police culture. We therefore argue for a shift from teaching to acknowledging learning through practice instead of learning through practice constituting missed opportunities for learning and being ‘due to chance’. The Norwegian police culture and the Norwegian Police Service not being a learning organization will strongly influence what Norwegian police leaders learn. Consequently, Norwegian police leaders learn management more than they learn leadership. We argue for combining management and leadership in future police leadership practices We also argue for the importance of enabling police leaders to construct their manoeuvring space, acknowledging the importance of a manoeuvring space in police leaders’ learning to ensure their learning results in changes in established practices.
