    <h1>About</h1>
    Haugsbakk examines how major technology companies influence educational policies, particularly in Norway. They explore the strategies these companies use, the key players in education, and the relationships and networks formed. International research shows that tech giants are leading efforts to create new long-term educational agendas, a trend that has intensified during the pandemic. This has led to the formation of new coalitions and complex networks with significant impacts on teaching methods. The study also maps out these networks and channels of influence in Norway, highlighting similarities across different countries despite varying political and educational systems. The findings suggest that new technology is widely seen as a tool to enhance teaching and learning, and the study is based on literature reviews and network ethnographic methods.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The article looks at the debate regarding the influence of the technology giants on educational policy. What strategies have existed on the part of the technology giants? Who have been the major actors within education? What kind of relations and networks have been established? The first part of the article focuses on relevant research internationally showing that the technology giants have taken the lead and that their objectives are to develop new long-term policy agendas. The development has been significantly intensified and to some extent changed during the pandemic. This has resulted in the emergence of new multisector coalitions and more complex networks which have potentially profound pedagogical implications. The second part accounts for a preliminary mapping of networks and channels of influence in a Norwegian context. Despite the differences between countries, political and educational systems, traditions and values, there are a number of the similarities in the field of educational technology. These include on a general level how the use of new technology is valued as a way of improving teaching and learning, but also how networks and relations are developed and function. The project that precedes the article is based on literature studies and inspired by network ethnographic approaches.
