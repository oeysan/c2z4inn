    <h1>About</h1>
    Haugen et al. conducted a study to see if Goal Management Training (GMT) could help people with schizophrenia or psychosis risk syndromes improve their executive functioning, which includes skills like planning and decision-making. They compared GMT to regular treatment among 81 participants. The study found that those who received GMT reported better executive functioning and fewer clinical symptoms than those who did not. These improvements were seen immediately after the training and six months later. The study suggests that GMT is a useful and cost-effective addition to current treatments, offering significant benefits for daily life functioning and mental health. This research highlights the potential of GMT to make a real difference in the lives of people with these conditions.

    Background 
Executive functioning is essential to daily life and severely impaired in schizophrenia and psychosis risk syndromes. Goal Management Training (GMT) is a theoretically founded, empirically supported, metacognitive strategy training program designed to improve executive functioning. 
 
Methods 
A randomized controlled parallel group trial compared GMT with treatment as usual among 81 participants (GMT, n = 39 versus Wait List Controls, n = 42) recruited from an early intervention for psychosis setting. Computer generated random allocation was performed by someone independent from the study team and raters post-intervention were unaware of allocation. The primary objective was to assess the impact of GMT administered in small groups for 5 weeks on executive functioning. The secondary objective was to explore the potential of the intervention in influencing daily life functioning and clinical symptoms. 
 
Results 
GMT improved self-reported executive functioning, measured with the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function – Adult version (BRIEF-A), significantly more than treatment as usual. A linear mixed model for repeated measures, including all partial data according to the principle of intention to treat, showed a significant group x time interaction effect assessed immediately after intervention (post-test) and 6 months after intervention (follow-up), F = 8.40, p .005, r .37. Improvement occurred in both groups in objective executive functioning as measured by neuropsychological tests, functional capacity, daily life functioning and symptoms of psychosis rated by clinicians. Self-reported clinical symptoms measured with the Symptoms Check List (SCL-10) improved significantly more after GMT than after treatment as usual, F = 5.78, p .019, r .29. Two participants withdrew due to strenuous testing and one due to adverse effects. 
 
Conclusions 
GMT had clinically reliable and lasting effects on subjective executive function. The intervention is a valuable addition to available treatment with considerable gains at low cost.
