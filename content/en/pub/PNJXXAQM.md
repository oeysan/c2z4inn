    <h1>About</h1>
    Echebiri's book explains how empowering employees can lead to innovation within companies. The authors emphasize that every employee has the potential to drive innovation, which is crucial for gaining a competitive edge. The book is divided into three parts: the first part helps trainers encourage employees to engage in innovative tasks alongside their regular duties. The second part discusses how organizations can involve employees in innovation, noting that this process may not always follow a set plan. The final part provides real-world examples from Finland and Singapore. This book is designed for employers, workplace trainers, and adult educators, aiming to connect theory with practice and encourage systematic employee involvement in innovation.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This volume guides workplace trainers in teaching the significance of Employee-Driven Innovation (EDI) and recognising that each and every employee is capable of being the driver of innovation. Given that innovation has become imperative to unlock competitive advantage, and that employees are increasingly regarded as a quintessential aspect of innovation, this focus on EDI and how to enable it is both necessary and opportune. 
 
The book is split into three parts: first focusing on helping trainers to address the challenges of getting employees to engage in innovative work besides their regular job tasks. How can organisations instil this mindset in their employees who see themselves as stalwarts of status quo? The book then turns to how organisations can engage employees in innovation, with an accompanying emphasis that the enactment of EDI may not follow a prescribed or planned flow. It then closes by offering real-world examples of the unfolding of EDI in both the Finnish and Singaporean contexts. 
 
The book is aimed at educating enterprises, both employers and workplace trainers, and adult educators in the practices and approaches to engage employees in innovation. It seeks to bridge, specifically the theory-practice nexus of EDI, and nudge the enterprises and TAE (training and adult education) practitioners that have yet to involve or engage employees systematically in innovation to seriously consider it.
