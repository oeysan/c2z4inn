    <h1>About</h1>
    Wierer et al. conducted a study to understand how different sizes of animal carcasses affect the diversity of species that visit them. They explored two main ideas: whether more available resources lead to more species (the more-individuals hypothesis) and whether varied habitats lead to more species (the habitat-heterogeneity hypothesis). By examining 100 carcasses of varying sizes, they found that larger carcasses generally attracted more diverse species, especially in summer. Medium-sized carcasses were particularly rich in species like flies and microbes. These findings suggest that both large and medium-sized carcasses play a crucial role in supporting biodiversity. Understanding these patterns can help manage ecosystems better, ensuring that carrion is distributed effectively to support a wide range of species throughout the year.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Resource availability and habitat heterogeneity are essential drivers of biodiversity, but their individual roles often remain unclear since both factors are often correlated. Here, we tested the more-individuals hypothesis (MIH) and the habitat-heterogeneity hypothesis (HHH) for bacteria, fungi, dipterans, coleopterans, birds, and mammals on 100 experimentally exposed carcasses ranging by three orders of magnitude in body mass. At the level of each carcass we found marginal or significant support for the MIH for bacteria, fungi, and beetles in spring and significant support for fungi, dipterans, and mammals in summer. The HHH was supported only for bacteria in spring, while it was supported for all groups except mammals in summer. Overall multidiversity always increased with body mass, with a steeper increase in summer. Abundance based rarefaction-extrapolation curves for three classes of body mass showed the highest species richness for medium-sized carcasses, particular for dipterans and microbes, supporting the HHH also among carcasses. These findings complement existing necromass studies of deadwood, showing there are more niches associated with larger resource amounts and an increasing habitat heterogeneity between carcasses most pronounced for medium-sized species. Higher resource amount led to increased diversity of carrion-consuming organisms in summer, particularly due to the increasing number of niches with increasing size. Our findings underline the importance of distributed large carrion as well as medium-sized carrion in ecosystems supporting overall biodiversity of carrion-consumers. Furthermore, the different responses in spring and summer may inform strategies of carrion enrichment management schemes throughout the year.
