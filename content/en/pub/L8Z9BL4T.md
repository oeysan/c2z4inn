    <h1>About</h1>
    Opstad et al. conducted a study to examine the effects of bariatric surgery on the levels of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a protein linked to inflammation and metabolic health. They followed 110 individuals with severe obesity who underwent either gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. Blood samples were taken before surgery and at six and twelve months afterward. The researchers found that SIRT1 levels significantly decreased after surgery, along with reductions in inflammation markers (CRP), body mass index (BMI), and triglycerides. These findings suggest that the decrease in SIRT1 is related to improved inflammation and metabolic health rather than just weight loss. This study highlights the broader health benefits of bariatric surgery beyond weight reduction.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. Weight loss after bariatric surgery improves the inflammatory state and risk of cardiovascular disease. Improvement in metabolic dysfunction might be associated with changes in the activity of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and we aimed to investigate the effect of bariatric surgery on its circulating levels. 
 
Methods and results 
This is a sub-study of a prospective cohort study, including 110 subjects with morbid obesity. The surgical procedure was either laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Blood was sampled at inclusion and six and 12 months after surgery. SIRT1 was measured in EDTA plasma with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mean age in the population was 43 years, 80% were women and mean body mass index (BMI) was 38.8 kg/m2. RYGB and SG were performed in 89 and 21 subjects, respectively. SIRT1 concentration was significantly reduced from baseline to six and 12 months after surgery, with mean values (SD) 156.8 (82.6), 119.5 (65.6) and 94.9 (45.6) ng/mL, respectively, (p ≤ 0.002, all), accompanied by significant reductions in C-reactive protein (CRP), BMI and triglycerides from inclusion (p < 0.001, all). Type of surgery did not differently modify SIRT1 levels (p = 0.09). CRP and triglycerides were both positively predictive of SIRT1 levels (p ≤ 0.001, both). 
 
Conclusion 
SIRT1 concentration was significantly lower six and 12 months after bariatric surgery. CRP and triglycerides independently predicted SIRT1 levels, suggesting that reduction in SIRT1 levels might not intrinsically be related to weight reduction, but to improvement in metaflammation.
