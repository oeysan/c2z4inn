    <h1>About</h1>
    Weihe and Smith-Solbakken examined the Norwegian public inquiry into the 1980 Alexander L. Kielland oil platform disaster, which resulted in 123 deaths. They found that the inquiry was closed to the public and survivors felt their accounts were ignored, leading to feelings of humiliation and perceptions of undemocratic processes. The authors argue that a more transparent and inclusive inquiry could have revealed crucial information to prevent future disasters. They suggest using a method called critical realism, which involves understanding events through multiple layers of reality and rational analysis. This approach, they believe, would support better disaster investigations and improve safety measures. Their study highlights the importance of transparency and survivor involvement in inquiries to enhance democratic practices and safety outcomes.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In March 1980, the oil-platform Alexander L. Kielland capsized in the North Sea resulting in the death of 123 workers. The Norwegian inquiry into the disaster was closed to the public and the survivors' accounts of the disaster differed considerably from the official account. The inquiry was experienced as undemocratic by those who had been in the disaster. Many of them felt humiliated, claiming that their opinions were not given due weight. We argue that if the inquiry had been more transparent and inclusive, important information would have been made available that might have prevented subsequent disasters. Such transparency would be supported if disaster commissions used a critical realist version of knowledge acquisition based on a layered ontology and grounded in an epistemology that uses retroduction and judgemental rationality. In this article, critical realism is also used to justify the interdisciplinary nature of the research, which starts with historical methods.
