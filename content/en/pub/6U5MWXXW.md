    <h1>About</h1>
    Rieker examines how France has influenced European defense integration through various initiatives outside the EU's formal security framework. Traditionally, efforts outside the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) are seen as potentially weakening EU defense. However, Rieker suggests that these initiatives, including those linked to NATO and the European Intervention Initiative (EI2), actually strengthen European defense by creating a more flexible and comprehensive security system. Under President Macron, France has played a key role in promoting this approach, which combines different strategies to enhance overall defense capacity. This perspective is important because it highlights the benefits of a diversified approach to security, rather than relying solely on formal EU policies.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Studies dealing with EU security and defence policy tend to focus exclusively on what is formally included in the Union’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Other initiatives taken outside this framework are frequently seen potentially undermining the development of EU defence – even when the intention is to strengthen defence capacity. This has been the case with the various initiatives taken within or closely linked to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as well as the recent French approach involving the European Intervention Initiative (EI2). An alternative perspective is to see these as integrated parts of a more flexible and differentiated European security framework where all these initiatives combined contribute to strengthening European defence capacity. Building on the argument presented in the introduction to this Special Issue, this article argues that France, as a leader in promoting ‘l’Europe de la défense’, has been instrumental in promoting this differentiated approach to European defence integration, especially under the Macron presidency.
