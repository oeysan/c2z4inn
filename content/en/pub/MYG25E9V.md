    <h1>About</h1>
    Standal et al. conducted a study to explore the role and professional status of Adapted Physical Activity (APA) specialists in rehabilitation settings in Norway. They interviewed APA specialists and unit leaders at six rehabilitation institutions to understand their work tasks, roles within teams, and perceived knowledge base. The findings reveal the specific duties APA specialists perform, their integration into cross-professional teams, and their status within the institutions. This study is important because it sheds light on the professional landscape of APA in Norway, which can inform practices and policies in other countries. Understanding these roles can help improve rehabilitation services and support the development of APA as a recognized profession globally.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Adapted physical activity (APA) is characterized by a strong orientation to professional practice. Currently, there exists limited empirical research about the professional status of APA in the context of rehabilitation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to describe and understand the professional status, role, and work tasks of APA specialists in Norway. For the purpose of the study, the authors conducted group interviews with APA specialists and individual interviews with unit leaders at six rehabilitation institutions in the national specialist health care services. The results highlight the content of the work tasks, the roles in the cross-professional teams, the status in the institutions, and what the participants perceive to be the knowledge base for their profession. Although these results may be specific to the Norwegian context, the authors also discuss possible implications of their findings for APA in an international perspective.
