    <h1>About</h1>
    Vibeto examines the use of slow motion in video games, focusing on a feature called "bullet time." This feature allows players to control the game in slow motion, giving them an advantage in overcoming challenges. The study highlights how bullet time enhances the gaming experience by combining player control with visual and audio effects, creating an engaging and aesthetically pleasing experience. By analyzing bullet time, Vibeto shows how video games balance gameplay rules with audiovisual elements to enhance player enjoyment. This research is important because it helps us understand how game mechanics like bullet time can improve the overall gaming experience, making games more immersive and enjoyable for players.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This article explores a commonly used feature of many different videogame genres, namely slow motion. It discusses the origins of slow motion, its ontological qualities and why it is important to analyze a game mechanic’s audiovisual elements when doing game studies research. Slow motion in videogames can be divided into two broad categories: cinematic slow motion and bullet time. The focus in this article is on bullet time, which allows the player interactive control and an advantage in overcoming enemies and obstacles found in the gameplay. This retooling of slow motion to suit interactive use has consequences for the aesthetic qualities of the effect. Bullet time takes advantage of slow motion’s intrinsic qualities to highlight player control, feedback, and audiovisual spectacle. Bullet time is a good example of how videogames’ gameplay mechanics have a strong focus on rules while also offering an audiovisual experience that creates aesthetic pleasure.
