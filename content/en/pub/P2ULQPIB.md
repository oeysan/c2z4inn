    <h1>About</h1>
    Jortveit and Daush conducted a study published in the Multicultural Education Review, exploring the experiences of Arabic-speaking parents in working with schools. Through interviews with five parents, they identified three key themes: expectations for collaboration, untapped potential in collaboration, and dealing with vulnerability. The study found that while these parents appreciate working with schools, they often feel unsure about how to participate effectively and believe their skills are not fully recognized. They feel excluded from the parent group and desire more inclusive meetings. The parents expressed a need for schools to create a welcoming environment that fosters a sense of belonging and encourages active participation among all parents. This study highlights the importance of inclusive practices in school-parent partnerships.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The aim of the present study is to investigate the perspectives of this parent group and their experiences of the home-school collaboration. Interviews with five Arabic-speaking parents have been analysed to identify processes and mechanisms they have experienced in the collaboration with schools. Three main themes emerged from the analysis: a) Expectations for collaboration, b) Collaboration with untapped potential and c) Dealing with vulnerability. The findings indicate that even though the parents value the collaboration with the school, they are uncertain when it comes to how to be involved and feel a lack of acknowledgement of their capabilities in the collaboration. They do not feel they are a valuable and participating member of the parent group and want the parent meetings to be an arena for more inclusion. They would like the school to facilitate for a better sense of belonging with the other parents.
