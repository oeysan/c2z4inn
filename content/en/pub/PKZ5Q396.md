    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    There appears to be broad support for educating critical- and ethical-thinking global citizens in higher education (Lilley, Barker &amp; Harris, 2014). Internationalisation of education and the education of global citizens are priorities of universities. Sending students on different types of programmes to foreign universities or practicum arenas – that is, internationalisation abroad – is one strategy. In most countries this is a strategy that reaches few students. Strangely, internationalisation at home has received less attention, even though this has the potential to engage all students by offering international and intercultural learning in the home institution (Lilley, Barker &amp; Harris, 2014). Namibia and Norway have launched an exchange programme for student teachers (multicultural practicum groups). International student teachers have school-based practicum together with students from the home institution. This means that a few students are getting international experience by going abroad while students that stay at home get an international encounter by being placed in practicum groups with international students. This article presents some result from the first round of exchanges. A qualitative research approach was used. The findings show that for both groups of students the cultural meeting has had an impact on their global competencies.
