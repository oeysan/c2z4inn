    <h1>About</h1>
    Wikan conducted a study on a new exchange program between Namibia and Norway for student teachers. This program uses multicultural practicum groups, where international student teachers work alongside local students in school-based settings. The study found that both groups of students—those who traveled abroad and those who stayed home—benefited from these cultural interactions. These experiences helped improve their global competencies, which include skills like critical thinking and ethical decision-making. This is important because it shows that students can gain valuable international and intercultural learning experiences without necessarily traveling abroad, making such opportunities accessible to more students. The findings suggest that integrating international elements into home institutions can be an effective strategy for fostering global citizenship.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    There appears to be broad support for educating critical- and ethical-thinking global 
citizens in higher education (Lilley, Barker & Harris, 2014). Internationalisation of 
education and the education of global citizens are priorities of universities. Sending 
students on different types of programmes to foreign universities or practicum arenas 
– that is, internationalisation abroad – is one strategy. In most countries this is a 
strategy that reaches few students. Strangely, internationalisation at home has 
received less attention, even though this has the potential to engage all students by 
offering international and intercultural learning in the home institution (Lilley, 
Barker & Harris, 2014). 
Namibia and Norway have launched an exchange programme for student teachers 
(multicultural practicum groups). International student teachers have school-based 
practicum together with students from the home institution. This means that a few 
students are getting international experience by going abroad while students that stay 
at home get an international encounter by being placed in practicum groups with 
international students. 
This article presents some result from the first round of exchanges. A qualitative 
research approach was used. The findings show that for both groups of students the 
cultural meeting has had an impact on their global competencies.
