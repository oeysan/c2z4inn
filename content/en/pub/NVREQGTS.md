    <h1>About</h1>
    Stensen et al. conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of the Student-Teacher Relationship Scale-Short Form (STRS-SF) in Norwegian early childhood education centers. This tool helps caregivers assess the quality of their relationships with children. The researchers focused on children under 3 years old, a group for which the tool's reliability was previously unclear. By analyzing data from 2,900 children aged 1 to 6, they found that the STRS-SF is generally reliable for both younger and older children, regardless of gender. However, caregivers may interpret the tool differently depending on the child's age, suggesting caution when comparing results between different age groups. This study helps ensure that caregivers can accurately assess and improve their relationships with children in early education settings.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The Student-Teacher Relationship Scale-Short Form (STRS-SF) is one of the most frequently used 
instruments globally to measure professional caregivers’ perceptions of the relationship quality 
with a specific child. However, its psychometric properties for children younger than 3 years of 
age enrolled in early childhood education and care (ECEC) centers are largely unknown. Thus, this 
study aimed to investigate and evaluate the factorial validity of the STRS-SF and measurement 
invariance across children’s gender and age by combining two large Norwegian community 
samples (N = 2900), covering the full age range of children enrolled in ECEC (1–6 years olds). Our 
findings indicate promising psychometric properties for the STRS-SF; thus, its applicability is 
supported for both younger and older children indiscriminate of their gender. However, some 
caution is advised when comparing latent means between older and younger ECEC children 
because professional caregivers interpret the STRS-SF differently based on children’s age.
