    <h1>About</h1>
    Lugo et al. conducted a study with 27 cyber officer cadets from the Norwegian Defence Cyber Academy to understand how self-confidence (self-efficacy) affects decision-making in complex cyber security tasks. They found that cadets who believed strongly in their abilities generally performed better. However, when tasks required counterintuitive strategies—solutions that go against common sense—high self-efficacy could actually hinder performance. This was influenced by the cadets' interoceptive sensitivity, which is their ability to sense internal bodily signals. The study highlights the importance of balancing confidence with awareness of one's internal cues and suggests that training programs should consider these factors to improve decision-making in cyber defense.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The rapid technical progress in cyber threats 
and cyber security poses increased cognitive demands on 
cyber officers. The macrocognitive demand characteristics 
placed on the cyber officers exceed those in most common 
military contexts and are new in nature. Research on 
decision-making competence within the cyber domain 
is needed to identify strategies and give a better understanding 
of how these strategies can have consequences 
depending on task characteristics. Belief in one’s capabilities 
to handle a certain task has been shown to be a key 
factor for cognitive performance. This study investigated 
how high self-efficacy negatively moderated intuitive 
decision-making tendencies on performance when facing 
a problem that required counterintuitive strategies. 
Twenty-seven cyber officer cadets from the Norwegian 
Defence Cyber Academy participated in an experiment 
assessing self-efficacy, interoceptive sensitivity, 
and decision-making. Participants with high situational 
self-efficacy generally performed better, but this relationship 
was moderated by interoceptive sensitivity. 
The findings suggest potential detrimental effects of 
intuitive decision-making tendencies in combination with 
high self-efficacy. Implications for training and feedback 
structures in cyber defense are discussed.
