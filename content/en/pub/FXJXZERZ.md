    <h1>About</h1>
    Johansen conducted a study examining why secondary school students in five European countries attend school despite being sick, a behavior known as "sickness presence" (SP). They surveyed 5,002 students aged 16 to 19 from Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Italy, and Latvia. Nearly half of the students reported attending school while sick at least twice. The study found that most students were motivated by external factors, such as concerns about grades, important lessons, and attendance rules. Some students were driven by internal reasons, like maintaining friendships and interest in school subjects. Boys, vocational students, immigrants, and those with less-educated parents often had intrinsic motivations, while girls and students with frequent absences were more extrinsically motivated. The study also noted differences in SP motives across countries.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This article investigates various motives for sickness presence (SP) among students in secondary school.DesignCross-sectional study.Setting25 secondary schools in Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Italy and Latvia.Participants5002 students between 16 and 19 years of age, 49% female.ResultsAlmost half of the students reported two or more incidents of SP. The study indicated that the practice of SP was mainly extrinsically motivated. The most often reported motives for SP were that absence could affect grades negatively, that important curriculum material was explained at the school and attendance requirements. Some students practising SP expressed intrinsic motivation, such as maintaining their social network and interest in what was learnt at school.ConclusionThe study investigated various motives for SP in secondary schools in five European countries. Extrinsic motivation for SP was more often reported than intrinsic motivation for SP. Multivariate analyses indicated that boys, students in vocational education, immigrants and students with low-educated parents more often reported intrinsic motivation for SP, while girls and students with high absence more often reported extrinsic motivation. There were also notable cross-country differences regarding reported motives for SP.
