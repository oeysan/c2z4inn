    <h1>About</h1>
    Alvinius and Larsson conducted a study to explore how people known as "boundary spanners" handle extremely risky and life-threatening situations within organizations. Boundary spanners are individuals who connect different groups or organizations. The study involved 71 participants and used a method called grounded theory to gather and analyze data. They found that in crisis situations, these individuals operate under strict conditions set by their organizations, which can limit their actions. On a personal level, boundary spanners must manage high-pressure tasks with no room for error and navigate uneven partnerships. The study revealed new insights into how these challenging conditions affect the dual roles of boundary spanners, enhancing our understanding of their function in crisis management.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The aim of the present study was to compare the existing conceptualization of the dual nature of organizational centaurs to discover what could be found in an investigation of organizational contexts characterized by risky and life-threatening situations. The study design involved a two-step procedure. The first step was inductive in character and followed the guidelines of grounded theory regarding selection of the participants in the study (further called informants, N = 71), data collection and initial analysis. The second step consisted of an attempt to compare this conceptual model to the existing ideal-typical descriptions of the organizational centaur concept. Managing crisis, disasters and other uncertainties as a boundary spanner can be understood in terms of a typology differentiated at the organizational and individual levels. The organizational part defines the prevailing conditions in uniformed, greedy organizations for boundary spanners who contribute to the organizationâ€™s foundation of competence and behavior, and also outlines the limitations this may entail. The individual part focuses on the human such as no room for mistakes and the management of asymmetrical collaborations. It was concluded that the special case of severely demanding conditions added new insights into the organizational centaur framework.
