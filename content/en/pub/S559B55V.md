    <h1>About</h1>
    Happell et al. conducted a study to understand the unique contributions of individuals with lived experience in mental health nursing education. They interviewed experts by experience who taught nursing students in Europe and Australia. The study found that these experts provide essential insights in four key areas: encouraging critical thinking beyond textbooks, fostering interactive and open communication, sharing personal recovery experiences, and emphasizing that mental health is an integral part of overall health. These contributions are crucial for enhancing mental health education and ensuring that service user involvement is meaningful rather than superficial. Recognizing and valuing these unique perspectives can improve mental health services and education.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    4.1 Introduction 
Embedding lived experience in mental health nursing education is increasing, with research findings suggesting the impact is positive. To date, research has primarily targeted the perspectives of nursing students and academics from the health professions. 
 
4.2 Aim 
To enhance understanding of the unique knowledge and expertise experts by experience contribute to mental health nursing education. 
 
4.3 Methods 
Qualitative exploratory research methods were employed. In-depth individual interviews were conducted with experts by experience who delivered a coproduced learning module to nursing students in Europe and Australia. 
 
4.4 Results 
Participants described their unique and essential contribution to mental health nursing education under four main themes: critical thinking, beyond textbooks; interactive and open communication; understanding personal recovery; and mental health is health. 
 
4.5 Conclusions 
These findings present an understanding of the unique knowledge and expertise Experts by Experience contribute to mental health education not previously addressed in the literature. Appreciating and respecting this, unique contribute is necessary as Expert by Experience contributions continue to develop. 
 
4.6 Implications for Practice 
Mental health services purport to value service user involvement. Identifying and respecting and valuing the unique contribution they bring to services is essential. Without this understanding, tokenistic involvement may become a major barrier.
