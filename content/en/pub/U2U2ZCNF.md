    <h1>About</h1>
    Sandsdalen et al. conducted a study to create a shorter version of a questionnaire that measures the quality of palliative care from the patient's perspective. They surveyed 128 patients in Norway to understand how important different aspects of care are to them and how well they feel these needs are being met. The new, shorter questionnaire includes 20 items and 4 single questions across four dimensions: medical competence, physical conditions, personal approach, and social atmosphere. The results showed that patients generally rated the importance of care aspects higher than the actual care received, especially regarding information. While the new questionnaire shows promise, it needs further testing to ensure its reliability. This tool could help improve patient-centered care in palliative settings.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Purpose: Patients’ views on quality are important to improve person-centered palliative care. There is a lack of short, validated instruments incorporating patients’ perspectives of the multidisciplinary palliative care services. The aim of this study was to develop a short form of the instrument Quality from the Patient’s Perspective for Palliative Care (QPP-PC) and to describe and compare patients’ perceptions of the subjective importance (SI) of care aspects and their perceptions of care received (PR). 
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Norway including 128 patients (67% response rate) in four palliative care contexts. The QPP-PC, based on a person-centered theoretical framework, incorporating the multidisciplinary palliative care, comprises 4 dimensions; medical–technical competence, physical–technical conditions, identity-oriented approach and sociocultural atmosphere, 12 factors (49 items) and 3 single items. The instrument measures SI and PR. Development of the short form of the QPP-PC was inspired by previously published methodological guidelines. Descriptive statistics, paired t-tests, confirmatory factor analysis and Cronbach’s α were used. 
Results: The short form of QPP-PC consists of 4 dimensions, 20 items and 4 single items. Psychometric evaluation showed a root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) value of 0.109 (SI). Cronbach’s α values ranged between 0.64 and 0.85 for most dimensions on SI scales. Scores on SI and PR scales were mostly high. Significantly higher scores for SI than PR were present for the identity-oriented approach dimension, especially on items about information. 
Conclusion: RMSEA value was slightly above the recommended level. Cronbach’s α was acceptable for most dimensions. The short form of QPP-PC shows promising results and may be used with caution as an indicator of person-centered patient-reported experience measures evaluating the multidisciplinary palliative care for patients in a late palliative phase. However, the short version of QPP-PC needs to be further validated using new samples of patients.
