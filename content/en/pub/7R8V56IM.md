    <h1>About</h1>
    Thorsen et al. conducted a study to understand how outdoor recreation affects the behavior of Eurasian lynx in southeast Norway. Using data from the Strava app, which tracks pedestrian activity, and GPS collars on lynx, they found that lynx tend to avoid areas with high human activity on a local scale but not across their entire home range. Interestingly, lynx were more likely to use areas with human presence at night rather than during the day. This suggests that lynx adjust their behavior based on the time of day to coexist with humans. These findings are important because they show how wildlife can adapt to increasing human recreation, helping to inform conservation strategies that support both human activities and wildlife habitats.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    utdoor recreation is increasing and afects habitat use and selection by wildlife. These efects are  
challenging to study, especially for elusive species with large spatial requirements, as it is hard to  
obtain reliable proxies of recreational intensity over extensive areas. Commonly used proxies, such as  
the density of, or distance to, hiking paths, ignore outdoor recreation occurring on other linear feature  
types. Here we utilized crowdsourced data from the Strava training app to obtain a large-scale proxy  
for pedestrian outdoor recreation intensity in southeast Norway. We used the proxy and GPS-tracking  
data from collared Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) to investigate how recreation afects habitat selection at  
the home range scale and local scale by lynx during summer. We ftted resource selection functions at  
the two scales using conditional logistic regression. Our analysis revealed that lynx avoided areas of  
recreational activity at the local scale, but not at home range scale. Nonetheless, lynx frequently used  
areas associated with recreation, and to a greater degree at night than during the day. Our results  
suggest that local-scale avoidance of recreation and temporal adjustments of habitat use by lynx  
mitigate the need for a home range-scale response towards recreation. Scale-dependent responses  
and temporal adjustments in habitat use may facilitate coexistence between humans and large  
carnivores.
