    <h1>About</h1>
    Jonsson et al. conducted a study to understand how facilitators of leadership courses in Sweden handle challenging situations during their sessions. They surveyed 221 facilitators using a web-based questionnaire that included descriptions of difficult interpersonal scenarios and questions about personality, leadership style, and specific situation appraisals. The study identified three main coping strategies: focusing on course structure, ensuring psychological safety, and self-reflection. These strategies were found to be positively related to each other. While personality and general leadership style had weak associations with these coping methods, situation-specific appraisals were more strongly linked. The findings suggest that using these strategies can enhance facilitators' self-awareness and confidence, ultimately fostering trust within the group. This research offers practical advice for training leadership course facilitators to manage difficult situations more effectively.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This study aimed to explore how facilitators of group dynamic and structured leadership courses cope with difficult situations during the course, and to relate their coping strategies to general individual characteristics and situation-specific appraisals. The study group consisted of facilitators of two of the most widespread leadership courses in Sweden: 110 facilitators of the course Understanding Group and Leader (UGL) and 111 facilitators of Developmental leadership (DL). A web-based questionnaire included descriptions of two difficult interpersonal course situations and questions on personality, general leadership style as well as situation-specific appraisal and coping. Three coping strategies were identified (factor analyses): Focus on course structure, Focus on psychological safety and Focus on own reflection. These factors were positively correlated. Weak associations were observed between the coping strategies and personality and general leadership style. Situation-specific appraisals covaried more strongly with the coping strategies. The findings suggest that reflection based on these coping strategies can lead to increased self-awareness and self-confidence on part of the facilitator. The findings may also help leadership course facilitators to cope more effectively, which in turn creates trust in the group that they are leading. The study contributes to the understanding of a limited research area; how leadership course facilitators cope with difficult course situations. The results provide guidance on how to cope more effectively. Practical implications include aspects to focus on in the training of leadership course facilitators.
