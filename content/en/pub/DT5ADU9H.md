    <h1>About</h1>
    Larsson et al. developed the Indirect Leadership Questionnaire (ILQ) to help measure how high-level managers lead indirectly, which means influencing people who are not directly under their supervision. They tested the ILQ with 225 managers and their 1,703 subordinates. The results showed that the ILQ is reliable and useful for leadership courses, helping managers understand their indirect leadership skills better. The study found that inspirational influence and communication skills are important for indirect leadership and should be emphasized more in training. While the ILQ is helpful for practical use, it is not comprehensive enough for developing new theories about indirect leadership. This tool can help managers improve their leadership style and better connect with their teams.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Purpose 
The Indirect Leadership Questionnaire (ILQ) is constructed to measure important parts of a theoretical model of indirect leadership to be used in leadership courses for high-level managers. The ILQ consists of 15 model-derived items plus extra space that provides for free-text comments. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the ILQ, its predictive power and practical usefulness in indirect leadership courses and to evaluate the indirect leadership model in the light of new data. 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
The study sample consisted of 225 higher managers and 6–10 of their subordinates (total: 1,703). The latter were working at least two hierarchical levels below their higher manager. The managers made self-ratings, and the subordinates rated their respective higher manager using the ILQ. 
 
Findings 
Results showed that the ILQ has acceptable psychometric properties in terms of dimensionality (two model-compatible factors were obtained), reliability, discriminability and predictive power. Previous problems with many “Don’t know” responses from subordinates working two or more hierarchical levels below their higher manager were considerably reduced. A qualitative analysis of the free-text responses showed that indirect leadership behaviors that can be seen as inspirational influence and communication skills should be more emphasized in future indirect leadership courses. The leaders’ personality, task-related competence and performance-orientation were also highlighted more than in the indirect leadership model. 
 
Research limitations/implications 
It was concluded that the ILQ is a useful tool in indirect leadership courses but that it is too limited to be used as a basis for theory development of indirect leadership. 
 
Originality/value 
The ILQ has acceptable psychometric properties and provides an easy-to-use tool to gain practical, usable knowledge of the “how’s” of indirect leadership.
