    <h1>About</h1>
    Benediktsson conducted a study on how schools in Denmark, Iceland, and Norway work with families who need language help. They interviewed 36 student teachers to understand their views on using child language brokers (kids who translate for their parents) versus professional interpreters. The student teachers shared different situations where they preferred one over the other. The study found that schools need to carefully consider who translates, looking at power dynamics, emotional well-being, confidentiality, and professionalism. It suggests that teacher education should better prepare future teachers for these challenges and promote long-term language support strategies, not just relying on interpreters or child language brokers. This matters because effective communication between schools and families is crucial for student success.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This study explores the complexities of intercultural family-school cooperation, particularly focusing on the dilemma of involving child language brokers versus professional interpreters in the context of compulsory schooling in Denmark, Iceland, and Norway. Utilising critical pedagogy as the theoretical framework, the study examines the experiences and perspectives of student teachers regarding cooperation with families who require language assistance. The data were collected via individual interviews with 36 student teachers. At the time of the study, they were enrolled in full-time teacher education programmes in their respective home countries and were in the final year of their educational journey. Drawing on their field experiences, the student teachers presented diverse scenarios in which they articulated a reasoned preference for involving either professional interpreters or child language brokers. As implications derived from the findings, it is evident that the involvement of professional interpreters and child language brokers in intercultural family-school cooperation necessitates a comprehensive evaluation by school personnel of the power dynamics, the emotional well-being of all parties involved, and the issues of confidentiality and professionalism. The study highlights the need for teacher education to address intercultural family-school cooperation holistically. It advocates for an enhanced focus on sustainable language support strategies, extending beyond reliance on interpreters or child language brokers.
