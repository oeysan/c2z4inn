    <h1>About</h1>
    Jøranson et al. conducted a study to explore how group activities with a robotic seal named Paro could improve sleep for nursing home residents with dementia. They worked with 60 participants, dividing them into two groups: one engaged in Paro activities, while the other received usual care. Over 12 weeks, the Paro group participated in 30-minute sessions twice a week. Researchers measured sleep patterns using wrist devices before and after the intervention. They found that the Paro group experienced better sleep, including longer sleep duration, fewer nighttime awakenings, and improved sleep efficiency. These findings suggest that social activities with Paro can enhance sleep quality, which is crucial for overall well-being and life quality in people with dementia.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Objectives: 
Sleep disturbances are common in people with dementia and increase with the severity of the disease. Sleep disturbances are complex and caused by several factors and are difficult to treat. There is a need for more robust and systematic studies dealing with sleep disturbances in older people with dementia. The aim of this study was to investigate effects from robot-assisted (Paro) group activity on sleep patterns in nursing home (NH) residents with dementia. 
 
Design: 
A cluster randomized controlled trial. 
 
Setting: 
Special care units in 10 NH in Norway. 
 
Participants: 
A total of 60 participants over 65 years with dementia were recruited. Thirty participants were recruited to the intervention group and 30 participants to the control group. 
 
Intervention: 
Participants participated in group activity with Paro for 30 minutes twice a week over 12 weeks or in control group (treatment as usual). 
 
Measurements: 
Sleep–wake patterns were assessed objectively by 7 days of wrist actigraphy before and after the intervention. Data were collected between March 2013 and September 2014. Data were analyzed using mixed models. 
 
Results: 
Positive effects on change in sleep were found in the intervention group as compared with the control group. The intervention group increased percentage of sleep efficiency, increased the amount of total sleep time and reduced number of nocturnal awakenings. In addition, a significant effect was found in reduced awakenings after sleep onset. 
 
Conclusions: 
Social stimulation through engaging group activity could contribute to improved sleep in people with dementia in NH. Increased sleep efficiency and total sleep time, in addition to fewer night awakenings, affect central indicators of good sleep quality across the life span. Improved sleep quality will also affect quality of life and comorbidities in vulnerable groups. We believe group activity with Paro to be an accessible and feasible non-pharmacological treatment for those who enjoy Paro.
