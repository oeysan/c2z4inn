    <h1>About</h1>
    Løvsletten et al. conducted a study to understand how outpatient commitment, a system where patients receive mental health treatment at home under a specialist's orders, works in practice. They interviewed healthcare professionals from both municipal and specialist health services to gather insights. The study found that outpatient commitment changes how patients are monitored and supported. However, new legal requirements for patient consent were difficult to implement. Additionally, collaboration between different healthcare services was often challenging. These findings highlight the complexities and difficulties in ensuring effective mental health care for patients under outpatient commitment, emphasizing the need for better coordination and clearer guidelines.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background: 
Patients with outpatient commitment have a decision on coercive treatment from the specialist health services even if they are in their own home and receive municipal health services. 
 
Objective: 
The aim of this study is to gain more knowledge about how the outpatient commitment system works in the municipal health service and specialist health services, and how they collaborate with patients and across service levels from the perspectives of healthcare professionals. 
 
Methods: 
This is a qualitative study collecting data through focus group interviews with health personnel from the municipal health service and specialist health services. 
 
Results: 
The results describe the health personnel’s experiences with follow-up and interactions with the patients with outpatient commitment decisions, and their experiences with collaboration between service levels. 
 
Conclusion: 
The study show that outpatient commitment makes a difference in the way patients with this decision are followed up. The legislative amendment with new requirements for consent competence was challenging. Collaboration between services levels was also challenging.
