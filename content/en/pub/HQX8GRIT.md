    <h1>About</h1>
    Cohen et al. conducted a study to understand what makes certain health professionals excel in infection control and prevention (ICP) and how a positive deviance (PD) intervention affects their behavior. They found that professionals who exhibit PD behaviors—those who perform exceptionally well—have unique socio-cognitive traits, such as a strong sense of external control, awareness of threats, and learning from others. After implementing a PD intervention, nearly 70% of the 135 participants reported changes in their behavior and the creation of supportive social networks. These networks help individuals feel accountable and important, regardless of their role. The study suggests that highlighting social connections in hospitals can enhance infection control practices and encourage positive behavior changes among all staff.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Past studies using the positive deviance (PD) approach in the field of infection prevention and control (IPC) have primarily focused on impacts on healthcare-associated infection rates. This research aimed to determine if health professionals who exhibit PD behaviours have distinctive socio-cognitive profiles compared to non-PD professionals, and to examine the impact of a PD intervention on healthcare professionals’ (HPs) behavioural changes in maintaining IPC guidelines. In a cross-sectional study among 135 HPs, respondents first filled out a socio-cognitive characteristics questionnaire, and after 5 months were requested to complete a self-reported behavioural change questionnaire. The main findings indicate that socio-cognitive variables such as external locus of control, perceived threat and social learning were significant predictors of a person exhibiting PD behaviours. Almost 70% of HPs reported behavioural change and creating social networks as a result of the PD intervention in maintaining IPC guidelines, 16.9% of them are a ‘PD boosters’ (a new group of HPs who have adopted the positive practices of PDs that were originally identified, and also added additional practices of their own). Social networks can contribute to internalizing and raising personal accountability even among non-PD professionals, by creating a mind map that makes each person believe they are an important node in the network, regardless of their status and role. Health intervention programmes should purposely make visible and prominent social network connections in the hospital system.
