    <h1>About</h1>
    Bjørklund et al. reviewed the use of thiol-based chelating agents, which are substances that can bind to and remove toxic metals like mercury, cadmium, and lead from the body. They found that meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is safer and more effective than older treatments like British anti-Lewisite (BAL) for lead and organic mercury poisoning. DMSA is also less toxic than dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS), although DMPS is preferred for acute mercury salt poisoning. The authors suggest that combining different antidotes might help remove cadmium and mercury deposits in the body, but there is limited clinical experience with this approach. They also reviewed the chemical interactions between these chelators and metal ions to help develop better treatments in the future.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Abstract: The present article reviews the clinical use of thiol-based metal chelators in intoxications 
and overexposure with mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb). Currently, very few commercially 
available pharmaceuticals can successfully reduce or prevent the toxicity of these metals. The metal 
chelator meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is considerably less toxic than the classical agent 
British anti-Lewisite (BAL, 2,3-dimercaptopropanol) and is the recommended agent in poisonings 
with Pb and organic Hg. Its toxicity is also lower than that of DMPS (dimercaptopropane sulfonate), 
although DMPS is the recommended agent in acute poisonings with Hg salts. It is suggested that 
intracellular Cd deposits and cerebral deposits of inorganic Hg, to some extent, can be mobilized by a 
combination of antidotes, but clinical experience with such combinations are lacking. Alpha-lipoic 
acid (α-LA) has been suggested for toxic metal detoxification but is not considered a drug of choice in 
clinical practice. The molecular mechanisms and chemical equilibria of complex formation of the 
chelators with the metal ions Hg2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+ are reviewed since insight into these reactions 
can provide a basis for further development of therapeutics.
