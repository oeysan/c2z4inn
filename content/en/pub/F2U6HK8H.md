    <h1>About</h1>
    Mutlu et al. studied six pufferfish species along the Turkish coast of the Mediterranean Sea in 2014 and 2015. They found that pufferfish pose a significant threat to the marine ecosystem. Four species were common, with Lagocephalus suezensis being the most abundant, while two species were rare. The study showed that riverine and meadow habitats are crucial for the nursing and reproduction of Lagocephalus species. Larger pufferfish were found at greater depths, indicating they migrate as they grow. The research also revealed that pufferfish populations are influenced mainly by habitat and seafloor depth, and secondarily by water productivity. Understanding these dynamics helps in managing their impact on the ecosystem.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Pufferfish represent a serious threat to the marine ecosystem in the Mediterranean Sea. To better understand the population dynamics of pufferfish and their relation with ecological parameters, six pufferfish species were studied in two fishing and one non-fishing zone in one of the most oligotrophic regions of the Mediterranean Sea during 2014 and 2015, including different habitats of vegetated and non-vegetated and seasons. The results provide information on pufferfish ecological status compared with more eutrophic zones in which these species could potentially worsen their impact. Four species were common in the study area and two were rare. The dominant species was Lagocephalus suezensis, reaching abundances of 11,000 ind/km2 at 25 m in October, followed by Lagocephalus sceleratus, Lagocephalus guentheri, and Torquigener flavimaculosus. The rarest species, Tylerius spinosissimus and Sphoeroides pachygaster, reached higher abundance and biomass in October and February than the other sampling months. The riverine and meadow habitats played a crucial role for nursing and reproduction in the population dynamics of Lagocephalus species, while T. flavimaculosus was absent in these areas. Sex ratios changed depending on season and location. The occurrence of larger individuals of Lagocephalus spp. and T. flavimaculosus at greater depths evidenced an ontogenetic migration. Overall, length-weight (L-W) relationships indicate isometric growth for each of the species studied. Pufferfish populations were primarily a function of habitat and depth of seafloor and secondarily with water productivity.
