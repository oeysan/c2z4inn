    <h1>About</h1>
    Dellsén explores the concept of reflective equilibrium, which is a state of balance between what a person believes and what they accept as true. The study introduces a probabilistic approach, suggesting that reflective equilibrium occurs when a person accepts claims from the most comprehensive and probable theory available. This means their beliefs are logically consistent and interconnected. The findings are important because they help explain how people can evaluate philosophical theories as a whole rather than in isolated parts. This approach can improve our understanding of how individuals form rational beliefs and make decisions based on those beliefs.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This paper aims to flesh out the celebrated notion of reflective equilibrium within a probabilistic framework for epistemic rationality. On the account developed here, an agent’s attitudes are in reflective equilibrium when there is a certain sort of harmony between the agent’s credences, on the one hand, and what the agent accepts, on the other hand. Somewhat more precisely, reflective equilibrium is taken to consist in the agent accepting, or being prepared to accept, all and only claims that follow from a maximally comprehensive theory that is more probable than any other such theory. Drawing on previous work, the paper shows that when an agent is in reflective equilibrium in this sense, the set of claims they accept or are prepared to accept is bound to be logically consistent and closed under logical implication. The paper also argues that this account can explain various features of philosophical argumentation in which the notion of reflective equilibrium features centrally, such as the emphasis on evaluating philosophical theories holistically rather than in a piecemeal fashion.
