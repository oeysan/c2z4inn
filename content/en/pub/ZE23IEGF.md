    <h1>About</h1>
    Strandmark et al. conducted a study to understand how bullying is managed in Swedish health and elderly care workplaces. They interviewed managers and specialists from one hospital and three municipalities. The study found that bullying is often hidden due to avoidance, unclear definitions, and lack of direct strategies. There were no preventative measures in place, and psychosocial issues were not prioritized in meetings. Supervisors were responsible for addressing bullying, often by splitting groups. The problem was usually only acknowledged when it became severe. The authors suggest that effective strategies to prevent and address bullying include recognizing the issue, adopting transformational leadership, prioritizing psychosocial concerns, supporting humanistic values, and working through bullying problems for long-term solutions.

    Abstract 
Aim: The purpose of this article was to explore workplace routines and strategies for preventing and managing bullying in the context of health and elderly care. 
 
Background 
Bullying is a serious problem in workplaces with consequences for the individual, the organisation and the quality of care. 
 
Method: Open‐ended interviews were conducted with 12 participants, including managers and specialists within one hospital and three municipalities. The interviews were analysed with qualitative content analysis. 
 
Results: Bullying was often concealed, due to avoidance, unclear definition and lack of direct strategies against bullying. No preventative work focusing on bullying existed. Psychosocial issues were not prioritized at workplace meetings. The supervisor had the formal responsibility to identify, manage and solve the bullying problem. The most common decision to solve the problem was to split the group. 
 
Conclusions: The findings showed that bullying was a concealed problem and was first acknowledged when the problem was acute. 
 
Implications for Nursing Management: Crucial strategies to prevent and combat bullying consist of acknowledgement of the problem, transformational leadership, prioritization of psycho‐social issues, support of a humanistic value system and work through bullying problems to achieve long‐term changes.
