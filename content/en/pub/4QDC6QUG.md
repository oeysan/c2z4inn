    <h1>About</h1>
    Larsson et al. conducted a study to understand stress levels in Lithuanian conscripts during basic military training. They measured stress through self-reports and hair cortisol, a hormone linked to stress. The study predicted that lower stress would be associated with emotional stability, fewer personal problems, positive attitudes towards the military, high engagement, adaptability, strong group cohesion, and good leadership. The researchers found that conscripts generally experienced low to moderate stress throughout training. While self-reported stress matched the predictions, hair cortisol levels did not show a clear connection to these factors. This study suggests that emotional and social factors play a significant role in perceived stress during military training, highlighting the importance of supportive environments and leadership.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The aim was to examine hair cortisol levels and self-reported stress amongst conscripts during their basic military training, and how they are related to four types of theory-derived determinants. The following prediction was made: lower levels of perceived stress and hair cortisol will be associated with: (1) higher levels of emotional stability (the individual nonmilitary aspect); (2) a lower degree of private life problems (the contextual nonmilitary aspect); (3) more positive attitudes toward the military, higher engagement in military service, and higher adaptability to military conditions (the individual-military aspect); and (4) stronger group cohesion and better leadership (the contextual-military aspect). The sample consisted of a total of 107 male Lithuanian conscripts. Assessments were made at the beginning of their basic military training, in the middle, and at the end. Established instruments were used on all self-reported scales. Hair cortisol levels were established through analyses of hair samples. Low to moderate levels of stress were found throughout the basic training period regarding perceived stress levels. Hair cortisol levels were mainly unrelated to the self-rating scales. Regarding perceived stress, the prediction was fully confirmed. The future value of the theoretical model is discussed.
