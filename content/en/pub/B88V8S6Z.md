    <h1>About</h1>
    Horgan et al. conducted a study to improve mental health nursing education by involving people with lived experience of mental distress. They aimed to create standards for integrating these "Experts by Experience" into the curriculum. The study involved focus groups with 50 service users from six countries to understand their views on participation in education. They identified three key themes: enablers and barriers, practical and informational support, and emotional and appraisal support. Using these insights, they developed nine processes for effective involvement, including induction, supervision, teamwork, preparation, mentorship, debriefing, role clarity, and equitable payment. These standards, called SCo-PE (MHN), provide a framework to ensure meaningful participation of Experts by Experience in mental health nursing education, enhancing the learning experience and service quality.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Introduction: Involving people with lived experience of mental distress in mental health nursing education has gained considerable traction yet broader implementa- tion remains ad hoc and tokenistic. Effective involvement requires curricula be in- formed by lived experience of service use. 
Aim: To develop standards to underpin expert by experience involvement in mental health nursing education based on lived experience of service use. 
Methods: Phase one used qualitative descriptive methods, involving focus groups with service users (n = 50) from six countries to explore perceptions of service user involvement in mental health nursing education. Phase two utilized these find- ings through consensus building to co-produce standards to support Experts by Experience involvement in mental health nursing education. 
Results: Three themes emerged in Phase one: enablers and barriers, practical and informational support, and emotional and appraisal support. These themes under- pinned development of the standards, which reflect nine processes: induction and orientation, external supervision, supportive teamwork, preparation for teaching and assessing, “intervision,” mutual mentorship, pre- and post-debriefing, role clarity and equitable payment. 
Conclusions: These standards form the framework entitled; Standards for Co- production of Education (Mental Health Nursing) (SCo-PE [MHN]). 
Implications for Practice: The standards aim to support implementation of Expert by Experience roles in mental health nursing education.
