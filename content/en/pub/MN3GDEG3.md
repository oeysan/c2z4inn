    <h1>About</h1>
    Flo et al. conducted a study using a method called "prey metabarcoding" to understand what small marine animals, specifically copepods, eat. Instead of using traditional techniques that can be biased, they used a new approach involving deep DNA sequencing. This method allowed them to identify the prey of these tiny creatures more accurately by analyzing DNA from their whole bodies. They found that deeper sequencing provided clearer insights into the diets of copepods from different seasons, locations, and species. This research is important because it offers a more reliable and cost-effective way to study the diets of small animals, which can help scientists better understand marine ecosystems and the roles these creatures play within them.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Prey metabarcoding has become a popular tool in molecular ecology for resolving trophic interactions at high resolution, from various sample types and animals. To date, most predator–prey studies of small-sized animals (<1 mm) have met the problem of overabundant predator DNA in dietary samples by adding blocking primers/peptide nucleic acids. These primers aim to limit the PCR amplification and detection of the predator DNA but may introduce bias to the prey composition identified by interacting with sequences that are similar to those of the predator. Here we demonstrate the use of an alternative method to explore the prey of small marine copepods using whole-body DNA extracts and deep, brute force metabarcoding of an 18S rDNA fragment. After processing and curating raw data from two sequencing runs of varying depths (0.4 and 5.4 billion raw reads), we isolated 1.3 and 52.2 million prey reads, with average depths of ~15,900 and ~120,000 prey reads per copepod individual, respectively. While data from both sequencing runs were sufficient to distinguish dietary compositions from disparate seasons, locations, and copepod species, greater sequencing depth led to better separation of clusters. As computation and sequencing are becoming ever more powerful and affordable, we expect the brute force approach to become a general standard for prey metabarcoding, as it offers a simple and affordable solution to consumers that is impractical to dissect or unknown to science.
