    <h1>About</h1>
    Bartura et al. studied how elite Norwegian biathletes' shooting performance is affected by trying to suppress unwanted thoughts under pressure. They found that when athletes tried to control their thoughts, it often led to worse performance, known as ironic errors. In two experiments, biathletes were tested under different levels of mental stress while receiving cues to focus or think negatively. Results showed that focusing thoughts helped reduce errors, while negative thoughts slowed reaction times but didn't increase errors. This suggests that managing thoughts can help performance, but more research is needed to understand how to best handle negative instructions under pressure. This study is important because it can help athletes improve their mental strategies during high-stress situations.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In rifle shooting, suppressing unwanted thoughts can backfire in one's performance, causing athletes to behave contrary to their desired intention and further deteriorate their performance. 
 
Purpose: This study examined how priming attentional and negative cues affected participants' shooting performances toward ironic error targets under cognitive load conditions in Stroop task across two experiments. 
 
Methods: Semi-elite biathletes (Experiment 1, n = 10; Experiment 2, n = 9) participated in the study. The study used a within-subject quasi-experimental design, particularly a one-way repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance and a 2 × 2 fully repeated measures analysis of variance, to determine the participants' hit rates and shooting response times (RTs). In both experiments, the participants completed the reverse-Stroop-based target shooting performance under low- and high-cognitive load conditions while receiving frequent priming attentional and negative cues. 
 
Results: The findings from Experiment 1 suggest that regulating repetitive priming attentional thoughts is efficacious in mitigating the likelihood of ironic performance errors and interference effects. The results of Experiment 2 show that repetitive priming negative cues resulted in negligible ironic error hit rates and slower RTs in target hits under high-cognitive load conditions. The Bayesian analyses provided evidence supporting the null hypotheses. 
 
Conclusion: Trying to control repetitive priming attentional and negative thoughts reduces ironic performance errors to a similar degree under cognitive load conditions among biathletes, regardless of interference effects. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of suppressing task-relevant negative instructions in reducing the likelihood of ironic performance errors under pressure.
