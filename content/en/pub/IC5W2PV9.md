    <h1>About</h1>
    Dellsén et al. explore whether philosophy has made progress and, if so, how much. They note that philosophers have varied opinions, ranging from no progress at all to having answered all major questions. These differing views are hard to compare because they rely on different assumptions about what constitutes progress in philosophy. To address this, the authors look at the more established debate on scientific progress for guidance. They propose four ways to measure philosophical progress: truthlikeness (how close ideas are to the truth), problem-solving, knowledge, and understanding. They also suggest a common framework to evaluate these measures. This study aims to clarify the debate and encourage more productive discussions about the advancement of philosophical thought.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Is there progress in philosophy? If so, how much? Philosophers have recently argued for a wide range of answers to these questions, from the view that there is no progress whatsoever to the view that philosophy has provided answers to all the big philosophical questions. However, these views are difficult to compare and evaluate, because they rest on very different assumptions about the conditions under which philosophy would make progress. This paper looks to the comparatively mature debate about scientific progress for inspiration on how to formulate four distinct accounts of philosophical progress, in terms of truthlikeness, problem‐solving, knowledge, and understanding. Equally importantly, the paper outlines a common framework for how to understand and evaluate these accounts. We distill a series of lessons from this exercise, to help pave the way for a more fruitful discussion about philosophical progress in the future.
