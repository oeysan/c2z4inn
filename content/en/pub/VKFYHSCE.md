    <h1>About</h1>
    Mavrantza et al. conducted a study to explore how walking in nature (green exercise) and walking with virtual nature scenes (virtual green exercise) affect mental health compared to indoor walking. They found that walking in nature led to the most significant improvements in mood and stress reduction, with noticeable changes in brain activity. Virtual nature also improved mood and helped focus attention, but not as strongly as real nature. The study involved 30 participants who walked at their own pace while their heart rate and brain activity were monitored. These findings suggest that spending time in nature, even virtually, can enhance mental well-being by altering brain activity, particularly in areas related to attention and emotional processing.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Physical activity in the presence of nature can lead to additional, more distinct mental health benefits such as lower stress and anxiety levels and an overall better psychological state when compared to indoor physical activity. Interestingly, the brain mechanisms underlying the effects of green exercise (GE) and virtual green exercise (VGE) on psychological responses are hitherto under-researched. The present study sought to deepen our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying the effects of GE and VGE during self-paced walking. Thirty individuals took part in the present study. Two experimental (i.e., GE and VGE) and a control condition (CO) were administered in a randomized and counterbalanced order. Participants were asked to walk for ¼ mile at a pace of their choosing and self-report their psychological states at various timepoints during the exercise trials. Heart rate variability and the brain's electrical activity were monitored continuously throughout the experimental protocol. An accelerometer was used to identify the beginning and end of each step. The results indicate that both experimental manipulations were sufficient to influence the majority of psychological and psychophysiological parameters. The most pronounced effects were identified for GE when compared to CO and VGE. VGE was also sufficient to evoke positive emotions and partially reallocate attention externally, although such effects were less pronounced than those observed for GE. The brain mechanisms underlying the abovementioned psychophysiological responses may be associated with significant changes in theta activity throughout the cerebral cortex as well as increased connectivity in the frontal and parietal areas.
