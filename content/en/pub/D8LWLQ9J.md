    <h1>About</h1>
    Dahl et al. conducted a study to identify key skills and knowledge areas for public health nurses in Norway. They used interviews and focus groups with 41 nurses to explore these competencies. The study refined 10 main competence areas, aligning them with existing literature and educational guidelines. These competencies are crucial because they clarify what public health nurses need to know and do, which can improve their training and effectiveness. By establishing these areas, the study aims to enhance the understanding of public health nursing roles in Norway and potentially influence international research and education in the field. This work helps ensure that nurses are well-prepared to meet public health needs and challenges.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Objective 
To explore the competence areas of public health nurses in Norway. 
 
Design 
A qualitative and comparative design was employed. 
 
Sample 
A purposive sample of 41 public health nurses participated. 
 
Measurements 
Data were gathered from focus groups and individual interviews. The interviews centered around an open question about public health nurses’ knowledge. They also discussed 10 proposed competence areas for public health nursing, developed from the literature. A qualitative content analysis was conducted on the interview transcripts, followed by a synthesis of the data from the interviews and earlier developed competencies. The 10 competence areas for Norwegian public health nursing were then refined. Finally, we compared the affirmed competence areas with earlier developed cornerstones and the new educational guidelines. 
 
Results 
The interviews revealed 10 competence areas. These 10 competence areas were synthesized with the 10 proposed competencies from literature. Ten affirmed competence areas, which mostly corresponded with the competences from literature, were developed. The affirmed competencies were supported by the previously developed cornerstones and new educational guidelines. 
 
Conclusions 
The affirmed competencies will help promote and explain the content and focus of PHNs’ work in Norway and may have implications for education and international research.
