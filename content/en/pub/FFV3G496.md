    <h1>About</h1>
    Roy et al. discuss the challenges of managing conflicts between humans and wildlife. These conflicts arise when animals threaten people's safety, livelihoods, or well-being, leading to disputes over how to handle the situation. Such conflicts can undermine community support for conservation efforts, especially when negative interactions with wildlife are frequent. The authors highlight that effective solutions are hard to find and often not applied in ways that are socially or economically sustainable. Each conflict is unique, making it difficult to apply the same methods universally. The study emphasizes that human-wildlife conflicts are also social conflicts, involving various species like elephants, snakes, and bears. Iconic or threatened species often receive more attention, even if they pose less danger than other animals.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Wildlife can pose a direct threat to the safety, livelihood and well-being of people. Retaliation against  the species blamed often ensues, leading to conflict between groups of people about what should be  done to resolve the situation. Human-wildlife conflicts also negatively affect communities whose support for, and benefit from, wider conservation goals is easily eroded by recurring negative interactions with species close to their lands, fields and homes. Effective and sustainable methods to mitigate and manage these situations are elusive or are often not implemented in a socially or  
economically sustainable way. Each situation is different, with its own history and unique complications, limiting the transferability of methods for reducing the impacts of species as well as people’s behaviour. 
Human-wildlife conflicts involve recurring interactions between people and wildlife yet are always underpinned by social conflicts between groups of people. The species involved may include a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic species – from large cats, bears, elephants, deer, primates, sharks, seals, crocodilians, snakes, rhinos and otters, to invertebrates and plants – and these can be of varying degrees of conservation concern. Typically, human-wildlife conflict cases involving threatened, iconic or well-known species attract the most attention, and in turn the highest volume of voices, opinions, arguments or media coverage. For example, although venomous snakes kill far more people each year in India than do Asian elephants, the latter inevitably tend to gather disproportionately more attention.
