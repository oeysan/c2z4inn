    <h1>About</h1>
    Egan's book explores how different Germanic languages, like English and Norwegian, use ditransitive constructions, which involve verbs that take two objects, such as "give" in "give someone something." The book includes twelve studies examining these patterns across various languages, including lesser-known ones like Faroese. The first part looks at historical changes in these constructions, while the second part focuses on current usage. The research uses both experiments and analysis of language data to understand why certain constructions are chosen and how they have evolved. This comparative approach helps reveal similarities and differences in language development, offering insights into how languages within the same family vary and change over time. Understanding these patterns can enhance our grasp of language structure and usage.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This volume brings together twelve empirical studies on ditransitive constructions in Germanic languages and their varieties, past and present. Specifically, the volume includes contributions on a wide variety of Germanic languages, including English, Dutch, and German, but also Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian, as well as lesser-studied ones such as Faroese. While the first part of the volume focuses on diachronic aspects, the second part showcases a variety of synchronic aspects relating to ditransitive patterns. Methodologically, the volume covers both experimental and corpus-based studies. Questions addressed by the papers in the volume are, among others, issues like the cross-linguistic pervasiveness and cognitive reality of factors involved in the choice between different ditransitive constructions, or differences and similarities in the diachronic development of ditransitives. The volume’s broad scope and comparative perspective offers comprehensive insights into well-known phenomena and furthers our understanding of variation across languages of the same family.
