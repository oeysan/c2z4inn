    <h1>About</h1>
    Taheri et al. conducted a study on the benefits of international collaboration and creative teaching methods in film education. They partnered with the TV, Film, and Drama School at Inland Norway University and the China Women Film Festival to help students from Norway and China create films about human rights. This collaboration allowed students to explore issues like equality, LGBTQ, and minority rights, fostering a global perspective. Over five years, students produced more than 50 films, showcased in both Norway and China. The study found that working together internationally and receiving feedback from external examiners enhanced students' creativity and critical thinking. This approach helped students reflect on their work and learn valuable skills for their future careers.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This research aimed to do some research around the importance of international collaboration and creativity with the partners from the TV, Film and Drama School located in Inland Norway University. The author of this article has been working with Baturu and the China Women Film Festival for many years and established a network of collaboration. The goal of this collaboration is to give students from 
the TV School an opportunity to develop their films about human rights, where students from Norway and China who are from two different part of the world come together and work on same film that concerns the same matter. These students have made more than 50 films that have been shown both at the Norwegian Embassy in Beijing and the TV School in Lillehammer coordinated; Equality, democratization and solidarity are essential elements in an academic environment. China Meets Lillehammer aims to bring Inland Norway university and China together to collaborate and contribute toward a peace work. While our students learn how to collaborate with international students, Chinese 
students get an important platform to express their needs about equality, LGBTQ, and minority rights. 
This project gives our students the opportunity to think both locally and internationally. The following research questions have been studied and discussed in this research: 
• The importance of creative work and evaluation methods used in this study. 
• The effectiveness of a new form of examination in which students must collaborate with the China Women Film Festival. 
• An external examiner from a different field of study criticizes their films and gives feedback. 
• A student would oversee and write a report/article after seeing a Role Play. 
• Goal oriented approach that student films from "Lillehammer meets China" from 2018 to 2023 will be collected to be shown both at Lillehammer and the Baturu Film Festival in autumn 2023. 
In this article we deep dive in this topic that how important is to collaborate in an international level and how students can learn from this. Students’ reflection on their own and other student’s work, and their experience with creative process and how these methods help them to be more creative has been discussed in this article. The result of qualitative research also with be discussed in this study that 
students describe their overall view of the course and the method.
