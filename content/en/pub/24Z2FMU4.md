    <h1>About</h1>
    Dunning et al. conducted a study to see if taking selenium and coenzyme Q10 supplements could help elderly people reduce oxidative stress and lower their risk of dying from heart-related issues. Oxidative stress happens when harmful molecules damage cells, and it can be measured by looking at levels of certain chemicals in the blood called free thiols. In this study, 434 elderly participants took either selenium and coenzyme Q10 or a placebo for four years. Those who took the supplements had higher levels of free thiols, indicating less oxidative stress. Additionally, people with lower free thiol levels were more likely to die from heart problems. This suggests that these supplements might help improve heart health in older adults.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background 
Serum sulfhydryl groups (R–SH, free thiols) reflect the systemic redox status in health and disease, and may be amenable to therapeutic modulation. Since R–SH are readily oxidized by reactive species, oxidative stress is characterized by reduced serum R–SH levels. Selenium and coenzyme Q10 supplementation may improve the systemic redox status. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of supplementation with selenium and coenzyme Q10 on serum free thiols and to study associations with the risk of cardiovascular mortality in elderly community-dwelling individuals. 
 
Methods 
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, serum R–SH were measured colorimetrically and adjusted for albumin in 434 individuals at baseline and after 48 months of intervention. Selenium yeast (200 μg/day) and coenzyme Q10 (200 mg/day) or placebo were provided as dietary supplements. 
 
Results 
After 48 months of intervention, participants receiving combined selenium and coenzyme Q10 supplementation demonstrated increased levels of serum R–SH compared to placebo (P = 0.002). In prospective association analysis, the highest rate of cardiovascular mortality after a median follow-up of 10 years (IQR: 6.8–10.5) was observed in the lowest quartile (Q1) of R–SH levels. Baseline albumin-adjusted serum R–SH were significantly associated with the risk of cardiovascular mortality, even after adjustment for potential confounding factors (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98 per SD, 95% CI: 1.34–2.91, P < 0.001). 
 
Conclusion 
Supplementation with selenium and coenzyme Q10 to an elderly community-dwelling population low on the two substances, significantly improved serum R–SH levels, supporting a reduction in systemic oxidative stress. Low serum R–SH levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in elderly individuals.
