    <h1>About</h1>
    Andersson et al. conducted a study to understand how older people in short-term care units in Sweden perceive the quality of oral care provided by nursing staff. They surveyed 391 older individuals and found that most had moderate to severe oral health problems. The study revealed significant differences in how these individuals viewed the quality of oral care, depending on whether they could care for their own teeth or needed help. Psychological well-being, gender, and oral health status influenced their perceptions. The findings highlight the need for personalized oral health information and care to prevent unnecessary suffering. This research is crucial for improving oral care practices in short-term care units, ensuring older people receive the attention they need for their oral health.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background 
There is a lack of knowledge about oral care among older people living in short‐term care (STC) units and how the quality of oral care provided by nursing staff is perceived by the older people. 
 
Aim 
To (i) describe person‐related conditions among older people in STC, (ii) describe and compare perceptions of the quality of oral care (including perceptions of care received and the subjective importance of such care), within and between older people who have the ability to perform oral self‐care and those who are dependent on help with oral care and (iii) examine the relationship between person‐related conditions and the quality of oral care. 
 
Methods 
A cross‐sectional study was conducted with 391 older people in STC units in Sweden based on self‐reported questionnaire and clinical assessments. 
 
Results 
The older people were assessed as having normal oral health (2%), moderate oral health problems (78%) or severe oral health problems (20%). When comparing older people's perceptions of quality of oral care in terms of perceived reality and subjective importance, significant differences appeared within and between groups. Psychological well‐being had a significant relationship with perception of the quality of oral care (both perceived reality and subjective importance), and gender and oral health status had a significant relationship with subjective importance. 
 
Conclusions 
Older people's perceptions of areas for improvement regarding quality of oral care is a new and important knowledge for nursing staff in STC units. Older people want personalised information regarding oral health and oral care. Registered Nurses who take the responsibility in nursing care for older people's oral health may avoid unnecessary suffering by older people caused by oral health problems.
