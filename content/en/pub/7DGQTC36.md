    <h1>About</h1>
    Happell et al. conducted a study to understand nursing students' perspectives on learning about mental health from individuals with lived experience, known as "Experts by Experience." They used focus groups with students from seven universities in Australia and Europe and analyzed the data thematically. The findings revealed that interacting with these experts helped students challenge their stereotypes and reflect on their attitudes towards mental illness. This process led to a significant shift in mindset, promoting more positive attitudes. The study highlights the importance of overcoming stereotypes to improve mental health care quality. This change is crucial for nurses, who will frequently work with individuals experiencing mental distress, to meet mental health policy goals effectively.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    1 Introduction 
Consumer participation is central to mental health policy. Negative attitudes of health professionals are barriers to realizing policy goals. Evidence suggests consumers (Experts by Experience) can influence positive attitudes in nursing students. Research in this area to date is limited and primarily from Australia and New Zealand. 
 
2 Aim 
To enhance understanding of nursing students’ perspectives and experiences of being taught mental health by an Expert by Experience. 
 
3 Method 
A qualitative exploratory approach was used. Focus groups were conducted with nursing students from seven universities in Australia and Europe. Data were analysed thematically. 
 
4 Results 
Student participants described how exposure to Experts by Experience challenged their views and attitudes and provided a mechanism for reflection, critique and change. The main theme “changing mindset” includes two subthemes: exposing stereotypes and reflection. 
 
5 Discussion 
This unique international study demonstrates the capacity for Experts by Experience to contribute to positive attitudinal change towards mental illness in nursing students. This changed mindset must occur for policy goals to be realized. 
 
6 Implications for practice 
Nurses in all areas of practice will work with people labelled with mental illness and experiencing mental distress. Overcoming stereotypes and adopting more positive attitudes is essential to deliver quality mental health care.
