    <h1>About</h1>
    Dellsén et al. explore whether disagreement among experts in a field, like philosophy, hinders progress. Some philosophers argue that their discipline doesn't advance as much as sciences because of constant disagreements. The authors examine this claim and find that disagreement doesn't necessarily stop progress. They argue that progress can still happen even if experts disagree more over time. However, they note that such disagreements can make it harder to identify which ideas or developments are truly progressive. This study is important because it suggests that disagreement might not be as harmful to the advancement of knowledge as previously thought, but it does complicate recognizing progress.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In recent years, several philosophers have argued that their discipline makes no progress (or 
not enough in comparison to the ‘hard sciences’). A key argument for this pessimistic position 
appeals to the purported fact that philosophers widely and systematically disagree on most 
major philosophical issues. In this paper, we take a step back from the debate about progress 
in philosophy specifically and consider the general question: How (if at all) would disagreement within a discipline undermine that discipline’s progress? We reconstruct two distinct 
arguments from disagreement to a lack of progress, and argue that each rests on underscrutinized assumptions about the nature of progress. We then provide independent motivation to 
reject those assumptions. The upshot of these considerations is that widespread expert disagreement within a discipline is compatible with progress in that discipline. Indeed, progress 
can occur even as such disagreement increases. However, disagreement can undermine our 
ability to tell which developments are progressive (and to what degree). We conclude that 
while disagreement can indeed be a threat to progress (in philosophy and elsewhere), the 
precise nature of the threat has not been appreciated.
