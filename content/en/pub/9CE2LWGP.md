    <h1>About</h1>
    Kersting et al. conducted a study to understand the quality of inquiry-based teaching in science classrooms. They analyzed video recordings of 73 lessons from 20 Norwegian primary and lower-secondary schools, involving about 450 students. They found that primary school students were better at systematically collecting and documenting data, while lower-secondary students showed higher quality in consolidating information. Inquiry-based teaching allowed students more freedom to make choices and improved their participation in class. These findings suggest that teachers can enhance inquiry-based instruction by focusing on specific phases of the inquiry process and empowering students to take an active role in their learning. This study helps educators understand how to better implement inquiry-based methods to improve science education.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    A large body of research has studied the role and potential ofinquiry to increase the quality of teaching in science education.While much of this existing research is based on internationallarge-scale assessment studies, we still lack a clear understandingof the factors that influence the quality of inquiry-based scienceteaching  in  actual  classroom  practices.  In  this  paper,  weoperationalise teaching quality through an observation manual,and we drew on this manual to systematically analyse video dataof instructional practices in 20 Norwegian science classrooms atthe primary and lower-secondary school level (73 observedlessons and about 450 students). We identified varying quality inthe individual inquiry phases and differences between primaryand lower-secondary schools. We observed that primary-schoolstudents collected and documented data more systematicallythan lower-secondary students and that consolidations wereslightly more emphasised and of higher quality at the lower-secondary than at the primary level. Moreover, ourfindingsindicate that inquiry-based teaching gave students more freedomto make their own choices and increased the quality of studentparticipation in the classroom. Based on ourfindings, we discusshow teachers can improve the quality of inquiry-based instructionand empower students in the classroom
