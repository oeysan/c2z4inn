    <h1>About</h1>
    Ohlsson et al. conducted a study to understand which leadership skills help leaders make their organizations more adaptable. They interviewed fifteen high-level military officers and analyzed the data using grounded theory. They found that leaders use "smooth power," which involves structural, emotional, and relational smoothness, to achieve adaptability. Factors like the leader's background, experience, and the organizational environment influence how they apply smooth power. Although the study focused on military leaders, the authors suggest that similar behaviors might be found in other organizations. The findings highlight the importance of ethical leadership training and could help in selecting and retaining high-level staff. This research is particularly useful for improving leadership skills in collaborative and multinational environments.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Purpose 
The study aims to gain a deeper understanding of what leadership skills are important for leaders in gaining adaptability in a hierarchical organization along with antecedent factors that influence the potential development of these skill sets. 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
A qualitative study was conducted by interviewing fifteen high-level military officers (Brigadiers and Colonels). Data were analyzed according to the grounded theory method and a theoretical model was generated. 
 
Findings 
A core variable was identified in the data analysis, the leader's use of organizational smooth power, using structural, emotional and relational smoothness, to gain organizational adaptability. The leader's professional background, experience and the organizational environment characteristics respectively interact as antecedent variables shaping the leader's contextual appraisal in order to implement smooth power. Further research suggestions are pointed out and practical and ethical implications are included. 
 
Research limitations/implications 
The study was completed in a specific context, a higher-level military staff, which makes it context specific. We hypothesize that similar behaviors may be found in other organizations but further research should be conducted to test this. The sample size is relatively small due to the chosen qualitative research method. 
 
Practical implications 
Practical considerations should be given to ethical and moral reflection within leadership training for ongoing use in leadership praxis, such as implementation and ongoing reflection of ethical leadership (Treviño et al., 2000; Treviño et al., 2003). Other practical impacts of this research may be for selection and retention efforts of high-level military staff workers. The model may also be useful for education purposes in order to increase awareness and abilities of smooth power concepts in an attempt to increase adaptability in military leadership. It may increase their awareness of skills rendered as necessary for collaborative efforts in multinational staff environments.
