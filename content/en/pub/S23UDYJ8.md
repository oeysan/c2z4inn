    <h1>About</h1>
    Sani-Mohammed et al. conducted a study to improve the detection of standing dead trees in dense forests using aerial images and deep learning. Identifying these trees is crucial for assessing forest health, biodiversity, and carbon storage. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and impractical for large areas. The authors used a deep learning technique called Mask R-CNN, which was adjusted to work with a small dataset of 195 images. They employed transfer learning and image augmentation to enhance the model's performance. The model achieved high accuracy, with precision, recall, and F1-Score around 0.85, 0.88, and 0.87 respectively. This automated approach can significantly aid in forest management and conservation efforts.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Mapping standing dead trees, especially, in natural forests is very important for evaluation of the forest's health status, and its capability for storing Carbon, and the conservation of biodiversity. Apparently, natural forests have larger areas which renders the classical field surveying method very challenging, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and unsustainable. Thus, for effective forest management, there is the need for an automated approach that would be cost-effective. With the advent of Machine Learning, Deep Learning has proven to successfully achieve excellent results. This study presents an adjusted Mask R-CNN Deep Learning approach for detecting and segmenting standing dead trees in a mixed dense forest from CIR aerial imagery using a limited (195 images) training dataset. First, transfer learning is considered coupled with the image augmentation technique to leverage the limitation of training datasets. Then, we strategically selected hyperparameters to suit appropriately our model's architecture that fits well with our type of data (dead trees in images). Finally, to assess the generalization capability of our model's performance, a test dataset that was not confronted to the deep neural network was used for comprehensive evaluation. Our model recorded promising results reaching a mean average precision, average recall, and average F1-Score of 0.85, 0.88, and 0.87 respectively, despite our relatively low resolution (20 cm) dataset. Consequently, our model could be used for automation in standing dead tree detection and segmentation for enhanced forest management. This is equally significant for biodiversity conservation, and forest Carbon storage estimation.
