    <h1>About</h1>
    Opstad et al. conducted a study to see if taking selenium and coenzyme Q10 (SeQ10) supplements could help reduce heart-related deaths. They followed healthy older adults for four years, giving one group SeQ10 and another group a placebo. They found that the group taking SeQ10 had higher levels of a protein called SIRT1, which is linked to reducing inflammation and aging in blood vessels. After ten years, fewer people in the SeQ10 group died from heart problems compared to the placebo group. The study suggests that SeQ10 might help protect the heart by increasing SIRT1 levels and affecting certain genetic markers. This research is important because it points to a potential way to improve heart health and longevity.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background: Selenium and coenzyme Q10 (SeQ10) possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
properties, potentially mediated via Sirtuin1 (SIRT1). We aimed to investigate the influence of a 
SeQ10 intervention on SIRT1 concentration, with potential interactions with microRNAs. Methods: In 
this sub-study of a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, healthy subjects (mean 
age 76 years) were randomized to receive an active treatment (n = 165, combined 200 µg/day of Se 
and 200 mg/day of Q10) or a placebo (n = 161). SIRT1 concentration and microRNAs were measured 
with ELISA and PCR, respectively. Results: After four years, SIRT1 concentration was increased in the 
active treatment group, with mean (SD) ng/mL of 469 (436) vs. 252 (162), p < 0.001, and decreased 
in the placebo group, 190 (186) vs. 269 (172), p = 0.002, and the differences between the groups 
were significant (p = 0.006, adjusted). Those who suffered CV death during a 10-year follow-up 
(n = 25 and n = 52 in the active treatment and placebo groups, respectively) had significantly lower 
baseline SIRT1 concentrations compared to the survivors (p < 0.001). MiR-130a-3p was significantly 
downregulated during the intervention and correlated inversely with SIRT1 at baseline (r = −0.466, 
p = 0.007). Conclusion: The increased SIRT1 concentration after the SeQ10 intervention associated 
with reduced CV mortality, partly mediated via miR-1303a-3p, suggests that SIRT1 is an additional 
mediator of the intervention, preventing vascular ageing.
