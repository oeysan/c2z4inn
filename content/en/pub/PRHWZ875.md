    <h1>About</h1>
    Olaosebikan et al. conducted a study to understand what qualities consumers in Nigeria and Cameroon prefer in eba, a food made from cassava. They found that people in both countries generally like eba that is cohesive and made from bright gari (cassava flour). However, Nigerians prefer eba that is harder and springier, while Cameroonians prefer softer eba. The study also identified specific cassava varieties that are popular in different regions. For example, the older variety TMS30572 is favored in Nigeria, while the newer Game changer variety is preferred in Cameroon. These findings are important because they can help cassava breeders develop new varieties that are widely accepted, making it easier to meet consumer preferences across different areas.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Nigeria and Cameroon are multi-ethnic countries with diverse preferences for food characteristics. This study aimed to inform cassava breeders on consumer-prioritized eba quality traits. Consumer testing was carried out using the triadic comparison of technologies (tricot). Diverse consumers in villages, towns and cities evaluated the overall acceptability of eba made from different cassava genotypes. Data from both countries were combined and linked to laboratory analyses of eba and the gari used to make it. Results: There is a strong preference for eba with higher cohesiveness and eba from gari with higher brightness and especially in Cameroon, with lower redness and yellowness. Relatively higher eba hardness and springiness values are preferred in the Nigerian locations, while lower values are preferred in Cameroon. Trends for solubility and swelling power of the gari differ between the two countries. This study also reveals that the older improved cassava genotype TMS30572 is a benchmark genotype with superior eba characteristics across different regions in Nigeria, while the recently released variety Game changer performs very well in Cameroon. In both locations, the recently released genotypes Obansanjo-2 and improved variety TM14F1278P0003 have good stability and overall acceptability for eba characteristics. Conclusion: The wide acceptance of a single genotype across diverse geographical and cultural conditions in Nigeria, and three acceptable new improved varieties in both locations, indicates that consumers' preferences are surprisingly homogeneous for eba. This would enhance breeding efforts to develop varieties with wider acceptability and expand potential target areas for released varieties.
