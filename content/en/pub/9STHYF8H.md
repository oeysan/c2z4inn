    <h1>About</h1>
    Capizzani et al. conducted a study on the ultimatum game, which involves one person proposing how to divide a sum of money and another person accepting or rejecting the offer. They explored whether expecting verbal communication would influence the amount of money offered. The researchers found that when both the proposer and responder anticipated two-sided communication, the offers were significantly higher. However, when only the proposer expected to communicate, it did not affect the offers. This suggests that the anticipation of feedback from both parties encourages more generous behavior. These findings are important because they show how communication expectations can impact decision-making and fairness in negotiations.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Anticipated verbal feedback in a dictator game has been shown to induce altruistic behavior. However, in the ultimatum game which, apart from generosity, entails a strategic component since a proposer may (rightly) fear that the responder will reject a low offer, it remains an open question whether anticipated verbal communication can be effective in increasing offers. We implement a between-subjects experimental design in the ultimatum game with strategy method manipulating the form of anticipated verbal communication (no communication, one-sided communication from proposers and two-sided communication) and find that offers are significantly higher in the presence of anticipated two-sided communication. However, anticipated one-sided communication from proposers has no effect on offers, suggesting, as found in previous studies, that it is the anticipation of feedback that is relevant.
