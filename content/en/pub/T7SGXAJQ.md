    <h1>About</h1>
    Stensen et al. conducted a study to understand why preschool teachers in Norway might mistakenly identify children as having mental health problems when they do not. They looked at 1430 children aged 1 to 6 and found that 9% were false positives, meaning they were incorrectly flagged as at risk. However, these children did show higher levels of internalizing (e.g., anxiety) and externalizing (e.g., aggression) problems compared to those correctly identified as not at risk. Teachers were more likely to raise concerns if the child had more behavioral issues or was older, but less likely if they had a close relationship with the child. The study suggests that teachers' concerns should be taken seriously and reviewed with parents and mental health professionals to support children's development.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Identification attempts in populations with a low prevalence of problems usually result in a considerable number of false 
positives. Thus, the aim of the current study was to investigate the false positive rate following nomination of developmental 
concerns by preschool teachers and the reasons for which teachers raise developmental concerns about children who display nonclinical levels of mental health problems.A total of 1430 children aged 1 to 6 years in Norwegian childcare centers were classified 
as true positive, false positive, true negative, or false negative by comparing preschool teachers’ nomination with their ratings on 
the Caregiver-Teacher Report Form, resulting in 127 (9%) false positives and 1142 (80%) true negatives.Compared to the true 
negative group, the false positive group received significantly higher scores on internalizing problems, externalizing problems 
than true negatives, conflict and significantly lower scores on closeness. Children’s internalizing and externalizing problems and 
age were the main factors that increased the likelihood of teachers raising concerns, while increased closeness in the teacher-child 
relationship reduced the likelihood of being nominated. Children’s gender and conflict level were not significant when adjusting 
for other factors.These findings suggest that preschool teachers’ concerns about children’s development should not be discarded 
as the false positive group did show elevated levels of problem behavior and poorer teacher-child relationship compared to the 
true negative group. Scrutinizing concerns in collaboration with parents and other mental health professionals may be beneficial 
to ensure healthy development for children with elevated problem levels.
