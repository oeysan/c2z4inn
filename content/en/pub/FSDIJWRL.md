    <h1>About</h1>
    Happell et al. conducted a study exploring how nursing students benefit from mental health education led by individuals with lived experience, known as Experts by Experience. This approach emphasizes understanding patients as whole individuals, not just their diagnoses. Through focus groups, students shared that learning from these experts helped them appreciate the importance of person-centered care, which focuses on the patient's unique needs and goals. The study found that this method encourages students to challenge traditional medical models and embrace recovery-oriented practices, which aim to support patients in their journey to wellness. These findings highlight the positive impact of involving consumers in nursing education, suggesting it enhances students' skills and attitudes, ultimately improving mental health care. Further research is needed to deepen understanding of this educational approach.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Holistic and person‐centred nursing care is commonly regarded as fundamental to nursing practice. These approaches are complementary to recovery which is rapidly becoming the preferred mode of practice within mental health. The willingness and ability of nurses to adopt recovery‐oriented practice is essential to services realizing recovery goals. Involving consumers (referred herein as Experts by Experience) in mental health nursing education has demonstrated positive impact on the skills and attitudes of nursing students. A qualitative exploratory research project was undertaken to examine the perspectives of undergraduate nursing students to Expert by Experience‐led teaching as part of a co‐produced learning module developed through an international study. Focus groups were held with students at each site. Data were analysed thematically. Understanding the person behind the diagnosis was a major theme, including subthemes: person‐centred care/seeing the whole person; getting to know the person, understanding, listening; and challenging the medical model, embracing recovery. Participants described recognizing consumers as far more than their psychiatric diagnoses, and the importance of person‐centred care and recovery‐oriented practice. Understanding the individuality of consumers, their needs and goals, is crucial in mental health and all areas of nursing practice. These findings suggest that recovery, taught by Experts by Experience, is effective and impactful on students’ approach to practice. Further research addressing the impact of Experts by Experience is crucial to enhance our understanding of ways to facilitate the development of recovery‐oriented practice in mental health and holistic and person‐centred practice in all areas of health care.
