    <h1>About</h1>
    Christiansen et al. developed an electronic database called TECLA to improve the management of prostate cancer treatment data at Innlandet Hospital in Norway. This system automatically gathers clinical information from electronic medical records for patients undergoing robotic-assisted prostate surgery. It also collects patient feedback through surveys completed on devices like iPads or smartphones. Between August 2017 and June 2018, 91% of patients consented to participate, with high completion rates for surveys before and after treatment. The study highlights TECLA's efficiency, as it integrates seamlessly into clinicians' workflows without requiring extra data entry. This approach could be adopted by other hospitals to streamline data collection for various surgeries, enhancing research and quality control.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    AbstractObjective: To present a code-driven, electronic database for patients TrEated with robotic-assisted radiCaL prostAtectomy (TECLA), developed at Innlandet Hospital (IH) Trust, Norway, for research, local quality control and to deliver data to the National Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN). Clinical data are directly extracted from the structured documentation in the electronic medical record (EMR). 
Materials and Methods:  
The urological department at IH treats about 200 patients with robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) annually. All consenting patients registered with the procedure code for RARP are included in TECLA. Clinical data are obtained automatically from the EMR, by structured forms. Patient-reported outcome and experience measures (PROMs and PREMs) are filled in by the patients on an iPad or a smartphone.  
Results: The basic construct of TECLA is presented. From August 2017 to June 2018, 200 men were treated with RARP, of which 182 (91%) provided consent for inclusion in the register. Of these, 97% completed the PROM survey before treatment and 91% at 3 months follow-up. PREMs were completed by 78%. All clinical variables for the hospital stay and for the 6-week follow-up were more than 95% complete. 
Conclusion: This entirely electronic surgical quality register is easy to use, both for patients and clinicians, and has a high capture rate. The data collection is linked to the clinicians’ workflow, without double data entry, so entering data does not add any extra work. The register design can be used by other hospitals for various surgical procedures.
