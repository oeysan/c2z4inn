    <h1>About</h1>
    Vibeto and their colleagues explore how video games, particularly first-person shooters like Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and Battlefield 4, are deeply connected to other forms of media such as films, TV, and books. They highlight that video games are not just standalone experiences but are part of a larger network where different media types influence each other. This interconnectedness allows players to engage with expansive story worlds that span across various platforms. The study emphasizes the importance of video games in today's media landscape, showing how they contribute to a culture where different media forms blend together. Understanding this helps us appreciate how video games shape and are shaped by other media, reflecting the dynamic nature of modern storytelling.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    "While all media are part of intermedial networks, video games are often at the nexus of that network. They not only employ cinematics, embedded books, and in-world television screens for various purposes, but, in our convergence culture, video games also play a vital role in allowing players to explore transmedia storyworlds. At the same time, video games are frequently thematized and remediated in film, television, and literature. Indeed, the central role video games assume in intermedial networks provides testament to their significance in the contemporary media environment. In this volume, an international group of contributors discuss not only intermedial phenomena in video games, but also the intermedial networks surrounding them. Intermedia Games--Games Inter Media will deepen readers' understanding of the convergence culture of the early twenty-first century and video games' role in it."
