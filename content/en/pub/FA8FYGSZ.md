    <h1>About</h1>
    De Witte et al. conducted a study to see if a new emotion regulation training could help anxious adolescents manage their emotions better. They tested 27 anxious youth and 43 healthy controls using heart rate variability, pupil dilation, and visual fixations while participants viewed emotional pictures. The training aimed to teach cognitive reappraisal, a technique to rethink negative thoughts. Results showed that both groups improved their ability to regulate emotions and felt less anxious after the training. However, anxious participants needed more effort to manage negative emotions. Despite some limitations like small sample size, the study suggests that this training could be useful in treating adolescent anxiety.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Anxiety disorders are the leading cause of mental illness in adolescence. While anxious adolescents 
show impairments in emotion processing and deficits in emotion regulation, few studies have attempted to improve 
emotion regulation within these populations. 
Method: This study used a multi-method design to test a newly developed emotion regulation training aimed at 
improving insight into emotions and instructing cognitive reappraisal. The efficacy of cognitive reappraisal was 
investigated in 27 clinically anxious youth (Age: M=12.36, SD=2.59) and 43 healthy controls (Age: M=13.07, 
SD=2.19) using psychophysiological measures. Specifically, heart rate variability, pupil dilation, and visual fixations 
were recorded while youth had to up- or downregulate their emotions in response to affective pictures in 
the Psychophysiological Indicators of Emotion Regulation (PIER) task. 
Results: The novel training effectively improved self-reported emotion regulation and momentary anxiety in both 
groups. Moreover, initial group differences in emotional reactivity mostly disappeared when participants were 
instructed to apply emotion regulation in the task. However, pupil dilation data suggested that participants with 
anxiety disorders required more cognitive resources for the upregulation of negative affect to counteract this effect. 
Limitations: The relatively small sample size and large age range could hamper detection of additional group differences 
that may exist. 
Conclusions: The current study provides evidence that anxious youth can apply cognitive reappraisal to a similar 
extent as healthy adolescents after emotion regulation training but may need to exert more effort to do so. This 
training could be a valuable addition to current treatment programs.
