    <h1>About</h1>
    Bjørklund et al. reviewed how mercury (Hg), a harmful environmental substance, affects the nervous system and how selenium (Se) might protect against this damage. They found that mercury tends to bind strongly with selenium-containing molecules, which can influence how mercury impacts the brain. Experiments show that selenium can reduce mercury levels in the brain and lessen its toxic effects, including oxidative stress, which damages cells. This interaction is important for understanding how mercury exposure affects brain development and function, and how selenium might help prevent neurodegeneration. The authors suggest that the effectiveness of selenium's protective role depends on the amounts and types of mercury and selenium present. More research is needed to fully understand these interactions in living organisms.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Mercury (Hg) is an environmental toxicant being present in the environment as elemental Hg (Hg0), 
inorganic and organic Hg compounds. The nervous system is supposed to be the key target for Hg toxicity. 
Research indicates that selenium (Se) may be used as a protective agent against Hg neurotoxicity. 
Therefore, the aim of this review is to examine new implications of the molecular biology of Hg 
neurotoxicity, and specifically to focus on the influence of Se compounds and interfering thiols on 
Hg neurotoxicity at the molecular level. Mercury and Se form stable coordination compounds, and Hg 
species are characterized by higher affinity to selenol groups as compared to thiol groups. Therefore, 
Se-containing molecules are targets for Hg binding that may at least partially mediate the biological 
outcome of Hg-Se interaction. Molecular interaction between these elements also involves mutual 
interaction between Hg and various selenoproteins. Experimental data demonstrate that Se treatment 
modifies brain Hg retention, modulates neurotoxicity and oxidative stress in the nervous tissue of animals. 
Human data also indicate that molecular interaction between Hg and Se may have a significant 
influence on neurodevelopment, brain functioning, and neurodegeneration. It is hypothesized that the 
effectiveness of Se protection against Hg neurotoxicity may be determined by the dose of elements as 
well as their particular chemical forms. Further studies are required to estimate the intimate mechanisms 
of Hg and Se interaction in vivo.
