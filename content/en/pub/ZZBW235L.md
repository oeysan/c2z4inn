    <h1>About</h1>
    Taheri et al. developed a virtual reality tool to help students improve their presentation skills. Many students struggle with public speaking due to fear, lack of confidence, and difficulty organizing thoughts. This VR simulation allows users to practice presentations in a realistic setting, interacting with a virtual panel that asks questions and provides feedback. Users can choose the difficulty level of the questions, making the practice more tailored to their needs. The tool also uses brain-computer interface technology to monitor stress and anxiety levels during presentations, providing insights into the user's emotional state. By analyzing data from multiple sessions, the authors demonstrate that this tool helps users overcome mental obstacles and become more confident and effective presenters.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Giving presentations can be challenging for many students due to a variety of reasons. Identifying and overcoming the obstacles and problems associated with presenting can help individuals to become more confident and better presenters. Becoming a skilled and good presenter takes practice and effort. Some 
common mental obstacles that make presenting difficult for some people include fear of public speaking, lack of confidence, and difficulty in organizing thoughts. In this research we designed a tool that enables educators and students to train and practice their presentation in an immersive Virtual reality (VR) setup. 
This simulation allows the presenter to interact with the panel sitting in front of them, get feedback and rehearse the presentation any number of times. The simulation incorporates questions posed by a virtual panel, with their complexity tailored to the user's chosen difficulty levels. The conductor of the simulation 
can activate responses that offer real-time feedback to the presenter. To assess the tool's effectiveness, we acknowledge the importance of capturing biometric responses to gauge the presenter's anxiety and stress levels during the experiment. To tackle this challenge, we've employed a brain-computer interface 
(BCI) to monitor stress levels for each presenter in every session. By analysing the results from multiple training sessions, we can showcase how the tool effectively assists presenters in overcoming mental obstacles and enhancing their presentation skills.
