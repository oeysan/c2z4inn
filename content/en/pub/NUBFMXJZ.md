    <h1>About</h1>
    Tryggestad's book explores Actor-Network Theory (ANT), a method for studying how people, objects, and organizations interact and influence each other. ANT looks at the connections and complexities that traditional views often miss. This second edition updates the original 2005 book, showing how ANT can be applied to various aspects of organization, such as technology, strategy, and consumer behavior. The book is designed for researchers and advanced students, offering a comprehensive introduction to ANT through organizational theory. By examining real-world examples, Tryggestad demonstrates how ANT can help us understand power dynamics, market mechanisms, and organizational change. This approach is valuable for anyone interested in the intricate ways that human and non-human elements shape our world.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Actor-Network Theory (ANT) has over the past few decades developed into a practical, challenging and intriguing tool for studying organizing. Its unique approach brings to light the multiple ways that people, artifacts, institutions and organizations become intertwined. ANT-inspired studies illuminate connections, complexities and interactions that are left obscure by mainstream views. This second edition of the 2005 book shows anew how ANT may be applied to the study of aspects of organization as diverse as technology, organizational change, routines, virtual organization, strategy, power, market mechanisms, consumer behavior, public administration and knowledge management. The book is suitable for researchers and higherlevel students, and serves as an excellent primer for those wanting to learn about ANT through the lens of organization theory. Actor-Network Theory (ANT) started with stories about strange worlds inhabited by scallops, microbes or Portuguese caravels sharing their lives with human beings. It is now a wide field of research explicitly open to new contributions, translations and problematizations. This innovative book writes a new chapter in the ANT saga. Based on a series of field studies, it shows very convincingly how this now widely recognized approach might be helpful to revisit notions like power, organization and market.
