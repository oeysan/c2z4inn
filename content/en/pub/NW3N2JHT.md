    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    Background: In recent years there has been an increasing amount ofresearch focusing on health in physical education (PE). Much of thisresearch includes discussions on different approaches to health andthese have different understandings on how health should be valued inPE. There is less research focusing on how to teach health, but there arereasons to believe that different approaches of health will producedifferent approaches to teaching.Purpose and research design: The aim of this paper is to review the literaturein order to investigate how health is taught in PE. The literature search wasbased on three different databases, SportDiscuss, ERIC and ISI Web ofScience. We found 1903 articles, but after the exclusion process weended up with 30. The didactic triangle (Gundem2011) is used as atheoretical framework in order to analyze the literature.Findings: The analyses show that in the biomedical and alternativeperspectives on health there are clear differences between how health ispresented to students, what students learn, and differences betweenteacher and studentsâ€™roles in practice. The studyfinds that differentperspectives on health emphasize different ways of teaching health in PE.Conclusion: In this review we have investigated the didactical implicationsof different approach to health in PE. By employing a didactical approach,we have been able to discern certain differences in how the biomedicaland alternative approaches see the content of health in PE, as well asthe roles of the teacher and the students respectively.
