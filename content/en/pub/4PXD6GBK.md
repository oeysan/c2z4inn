    <h1>About</h1>
    Purkarthofer and Steien studied how multilingual parents in Norway decide which languages to pass on to their children. They interviewed six families, three with parents from the Democratic Republic of Congo and three with at least one parent from Germany. The researchers found that parents base their language choices on their own past experiences and current family situations. They aim to maintain continuity in language use across generations while also being flexible to adapt to new circumstances. This study highlights the importance of family memories and experiences in shaping language policies at home, showing how parents balance tradition with the need to adjust to changing environments. Understanding these decisions helps explain how multilingual families manage their children's language learning.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In this article, we examine how parents explain their choices of transmitting certain languages to their children, a key element of family language policies (FLP), in light of their dynamic linguistic repertoires and biographic experiences. Contributing to the framework of FLP, we focus in particular on parents’ memories, their narratives of multilingual upbringing in the past, and how these are used to construct present FLP. We analyze conversations where six multilingual parents in Norway talk about their experiences and intentions regarding FLP, and in particular, their reasons for the transmission of (some of their) languages to their children. The parents of three of the families are from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and in three others at least one of the parents migrated from Germany. We find that the parents align their decisions with both prior and new experiences. They relate to their language(s), their past and their current family life, and express the wish for continuity across the lifespan. At the same time, they demonstrate a certain flexibility and willingness to adapt to the constantly changing environments that they and their children experience and in which they navigate. Through their complex accounts, their memories and lived language experiences, we can understand parents’ manifold positions as regards their children’s linguistic repertoires.
