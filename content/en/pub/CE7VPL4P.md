    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    Virtual reality (VR) is known to cause cybersickness, and studies report that deteriorations of postural stability coincides with the onset cybersickness. It is unclear whether these deteriorations are the cause or a consequence of cybersickness. Thus, it is also unclear whether measures of postural stability may either predict susceptibility (cause) or objectively measure (consequence) the malaise. To examine whether deteriorations of postural stability can either predict or objectively measure cybersickness, healthy active adults (n = 50) were exposed to one of two different 10 min 360˚VR videos. Postural stability was assessed, using a force platform, before exposure with eyes open (baseline) and eyes closed, during the first and last minute of exposure, and approximately 10 min after exposure. The deterioration of postural stability from baseline to the first minute of exposure was larger in participants who reported cybersickness, compared to those who did not, for both total trace length (p = 0.017) and standard deviation velocity (p = 0.008). However, there was substantial individual variation and overlap between sick and well participants. Deteriorations of postural stability from baseline to the eyes closed condition did not differ between sick and well participants (trace length, p = 0.270; standard deviation velocity, p = 0.112). There was a significant correlation between the severity of cybersickness and the change of postural stability from the first to the last minute of VR exposure for trace length (rs=0.32, p = 0.027), but not standard deviation velocity (rs=0.20, p = 0.187). The deteriorations had returned to baseline levels 10 min after exposure. These findings suggest that deteriorations of postural stability was both a predictor and objective measure at a group level. However, the large individual variation, substantial overlap between sick and well participants, and the limited strength of correlations suggest that deterioration of postural stability has limited practical value as both a predictor and objective measure. These findings emphasize the complicated nature of the relationship between cybersickness and postural stability.
