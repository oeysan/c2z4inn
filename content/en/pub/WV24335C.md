    <h1>About</h1>
    Jansen et al. conducted a study to examine the levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the blood of patients before and after bariatric surgery. POPs are harmful chemicals stored in body fat, and rapid weight loss can release them into the bloodstream. The researchers analyzed blood samples from 63 patients, finding that POP levels increased significantly one year after surgery. For example, levels of certain pollutants like PCB-153 rose by 46.7% to 83.1%. Notably, 5% of participants had POP levels exceeding health guidelines. This is particularly concerning for women of childbearing age, as these pollutants could potentially affect infants. The study highlights the need for monitoring POP levels in patients undergoing significant weight loss.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background 
With the growing prevalence of obesity, an increased number of bariatric surgeries are being performed. Lipophilic persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are stored in adipose tissue, and an increased release of lipophilic POPs into the blood circulation may occur following rapid weight loss such as after bariatric surgery. 
 
Objectives 
To evaluate and compare POP levels in serum before and after bariatric surgery, and to assess if the POP levels exceeded health based guideline values, with particular focus on women of childbearing age (WCBA). 
 
Methods 
Serum samples from 63 patients before and one year after bariatric surgery were analysed for organochlorine pesticides (OCPs); polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); and brominated flame retardants (BFRs). 
 
Results 
Mean weight loss one year after surgery was 32.1 kg. The levels of all the analysed POPs in serum increased during the study period. Median levels of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE), hexachlorobenzen (HCB) and PCB-153 increased from 90.2 ng/g lipid weight (lw) to 158.5 ng/g lw, from 21.1 ng/g lw to 36.4 ng/g lw and from 48.7 ng/g lw to 71.5 ng/g lw, respectively. The highest percentage increase was observed for PCB − 138, with 83.1%. BFRs were detected in low sample numbers and at low levels. Guideline values for ΣPCB6 in serum were exceeded for 5% of the participants. 
 
Conclusions 
Weight loss after bariatric surgery resulted in increases of POPs levels in serum between 46.7%–83.1%. Guideline values for ΣPCB6 in serum were exceeded for 5% of the participants. For WCBA, the possible transfer of comparable levels to infants warrants further attention.
