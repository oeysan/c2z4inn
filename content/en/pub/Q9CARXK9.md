    <h1>About</h1>
    Ferguson-Cradler examines how fisheries biologists in the early 20th century tried to define and measure overfishing. They found that fish were seen both as scientific subjects and economic resources, making it hard to separate biological facts from economic and political influences. The study reveals that early fisheries science combined various models that included biological, physical, economic, and political factors. This complexity made it difficult for scientists to agree on what overfishing actually meant, with some doubting its validity. The research highlights the challenges faced by early scientists in distinguishing between these intertwined factors, which is important for understanding how political and economic interests can affect scientific research and environmental policies.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This article looks at how fisheries biologists of the early twentieth century concep‑tualized and measured overfishing and attempted to make it a scientific object. Con‑sidering both theorizing and physical practices, the essay shows that categories and understandings  of  both  the  fishing  industry  and  fisheries  science  were  deeply  and,  at  times,  inextricably  interwoven.  Fish  were  both  scientific  and  economic  objects.  The  various  models  fisheries  science  used  to  understand  the  world  reflected  amal‑gamations of biological, physical, economic, and political factors. As a result, scien‑tists  had  great  difficulty  stabilizing  the  concept  of  overfishing  and  many  influential  scholars into the 1930s even doubted the coherence of the concept. In light of recent literature in history of fisheries and environmental social sciences that critiques the infiltration  of  political  and  economic  imperatives  into  fisheries  and  environmental  sciences  more  generally,  this  essay  highlights  both  how  early  fisheries  scientists  understood  their  field  of  study  as  the  entire  combination  of  interactions  between  political, economic, biological and physical factors and the work that was necessary to separate them.
