    <h1>About</h1>
    Cook et al. conducted a study to improve the diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA), a common joint disease causing pain and limited mobility. They developed a new method using non-destructive infrared light techniques, avoiding harmful radiation and invasive procedures. By combining two types of spectroscopy (NIR Raman scattering and NIR-SWIR absorption), they created a detailed "fingerprint" of human cartilage. This method accurately classified tissue samples from OA patients and controls, showing high precision and improved performance compared to using each technique alone. The study suggests this approach could lead to better early detection and treatment of OA, benefiting many adults, especially the elderly. This innovative technique is compatible with various optical devices, making it practical for clinical use.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease, presented as wearing down of articular cartilage and resulting in pain and limited mobility for 1 in 10 adults in the UK [Osteoarthr. Cartil. 28(6), 792 (2020)10.1016/j.joca.2020.03.004]. There is an unmet need for patient friendly paradigms for clinical assessment that do not use ionizing radiation (CT), exogenous contrast enhancing dyes (MRI), and biopsy. Hence, techniques that use non-destructive, near- and shortwave infrared light (NIR, SWIR) may be ideal for providing label-free, deep tissue interrogation. This study demonstrates multimodal “spectromics”, low-level abstraction data fusion of non-destructive NIR Raman scattering spectroscopy and NIR-SWIR absorption spectroscopy, providing an enhanced, interpretable “fingerprint” for diagnosis of OA in human cartilage. This is proposed as method level innovation applicable to both arthro- or endoscopic (minimally invasive) or potential exoscopic (non-invasive) optical approaches. Samples were excised from femoral heads post hip arthroplasty from OA patients (n = 13) and age-matched control (osteoporosis) patients (n = 14). Under multivariate statistical analysis and supervised machine learning, tissue was classified to high precision: 100% segregation of tissue classes (using 10 principal components), and a classification accuracy of 95% (control) and 80% (OA), using the combined vibrational data. There was a marked performance improvement (5 to 6-fold for multivariate analysis) using the spectromics fingerprint compared to results obtained from solely Raman or NIR-SWIR data. Furthermore, clinically relevant tissue components were identified through discriminatory spectral features – spectromics biomarkers – allowing interpretable feedback from the enhanced fingerprint. In summary, spectromics provides comprehensive information for early OA detection and disease stratification, imperative for effective intervention in treating the degenerative onset disease for an aging demographic. This novel and elegant approach for data fusion is compatible with various NIR-SWIR optical devices that will allow deep non-destructive penetration.
