    <h1>About</h1>
    Drożdżowicz explores how well we understand what others say in everyday conversations. They highlight that while we often feel confident in our comprehension, research shows that our understanding can be imprecise or incomplete without us realizing it. This imprecision is actually a normal part of how our brains process language. The study suggests that estimating how accurately we understand each other is challenging because of this natural vagueness. Despite potential misunderstandings, people can often recognize and correct these gaps through further clarification. Drożdżowicz emphasizes the need for more research to better understand these communication dynamics and how we can improve our ability to interpret what others mean. This insight is important for enhancing effective communication in daily life.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    How  good  are  we  at  understanding  what  others  communicate?  It  often  seems  to  us,  at  least,  that  we  understand  quite  well  what  others  convey  when  speaking  in  a  familiar  language.  However,  a  growing  body  of  evidence  from  the  psychology  of  language suggests that in various communicative settings comprehenders routinely form  linguistic  representations  that  are  underdetermined,  “sketchy”,  “shallow”  or  imprecise,  often  without  noticing  it.  The  paper  discusses  some  important  conse-quences  of  this  evidence.  Following  recent  discussions  in  this  strand  of  research,  I  outline how the evidence is currently best interpreted as supporting a view on which operating  at  a  certain  level  of  imprecision  and  underdetermination  is  a  functional feature of the system responsible for comprehension of linguistic utterances in hu-mans.  That  this  kind  of  imprecision  and  underdetermination  is  part  and  parcel  of  linguistic  interactions,  makes  the  exact  success  rate  of  comprehension  particularly  hard  to  estimate.  This  poses  a  unique  and  interesting  challenge  for  assessing  the  quality of linguistic comprehension. Understanding what a speaker intended to con-vey  with  a  linguistic  utterance  may  be  less  transparent  than  it  appears  to  us.  I  will  discuss  the  extent  to  which  this  evidence  may  lead  to  pessimism  about  how  good  we  are  at  comprehending  what  others  communicate.  However,  as  I  will  argue  in  the last part of the paper, in various cases language users can be sensitive to some types  of  imprecision  and  underdetermination  in  comprehension  and  make  up  for  it  by  means  of  various  forms  of  post  hoc  deliberation.  I  will  describe  some  such  clarificatory  contexts  and  end  by  charting  a  map  of  important  issues  that  require  further  investigation.
