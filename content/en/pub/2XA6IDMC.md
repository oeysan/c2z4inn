    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    The question we ask in this paper is what role digital tools play for students who struggle with reading and writing difficulties. Being able to read and write are basic skills. Therefore, it is important that the school and the teachers do what they can to help these students. We know that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can be a valuable tool for learners with various kinds of disabilities. This is especially true for students who struggle with reading and writing. However, it seems that digital technology used to compensate for different learning impairments has not reached the classroom to a full extent. This paper is based on findings in the Norwegian research project The Function of Special Education (the SPEED project). The project has collected a broad range of empirical data from students, teachers and parents on level 5 to 9, including data on the use of computers in both the ordinary teaching and special education. A key finding is that ICT seems to play a modest role in everyday schoolwork for students with reading and writing difficulties. On the other hand, we find that both teachers and students report that ICT is very useful as a compensatory or alternative tool for this group of students. The paper will attempt to explain this apparent contradiction.
