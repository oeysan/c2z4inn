    <h1>About</h1>
    Larsson et al. conducted a literature review to explore how group dynamic interventions can help leaders develop in organizations. These interventions aim to improve leaders' understanding of themselves and their relationships with others. The review analyzed nine studies but found limited evidence to determine the overall effectiveness of these interventions. However, they identified some trends: practical skills like problem-solving seem beneficial, while interventions focusing on self-awareness and group sensitivity show positive effects. There is little evidence supporting the improvement of interpersonal skills through these methods. Factors like group characteristics, facilitator qualities, and a safe environment can influence outcomes. The authors emphasize that more research is needed to fully understand the impact of group dynamic interventions on leadership development.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This literature review aimed to synthesize the existing research on group dynamic interventions that are designed to enhance individual leadership development in organisations. Such interventions are typically intended to help leaders learn about both themselves and interpersonal relationships. A systematic mixed studies literature review with an integrated design was undertaken. The selection process resulted in nine articles that met the inclusion criteria. The scarcity of studies means that no reliable conclusion could be drawn on the sizes of effects and, thus, whether group dynamic interventions are effective or not. Given this situation, four tendencies could still be identified. First, interventions involving practical skills (e.g., problem-solving techniques) appear to be effective. Second, interventions focusing on inner processes (e.g., self-awareness, self-acceptance, and sensitivity to group processes) appear to have some favourable effects. Third, little evidence was found regarding the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving leadersâ€™ interpersonal skills. Fourth, identified enablers and neutralizers include group characteristics, facilitator qualities, intervention goals and focus, a safe climate, and opportunities for practice. The lack of evidence regarding effectiveness does not mean that group dynamic interventions are ineffective. It means only that more research is necessary to evaluate this type of developmental intervention.
