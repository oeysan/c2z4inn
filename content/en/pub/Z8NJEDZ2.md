    <h1>About</h1>
    Larsson and Alvinius conducted a study to understand how men and women rate their own leadership behaviors in different work environments. They surveyed nearly 1,900 Swedish leaders using a questionnaire. The findings showed that female leaders rated themselves more positively than male leaders in female-dominated and mixed-gender workplaces. However, in male-dominated settings, the differences between male and female leaders' self-ratings were minimal. Women generally felt more confident about their leadership in female-dominated and mixed-gender environments compared to male-dominated ones. For male leaders, the work environment had less impact on their self-ratings. These results highlight the influence of organizational culture and the increasing number of women in leadership roles in Sweden.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The aim of the study was to compare the self-rated leadership behaviors of men and women in female-dominated, male-dominated and mixed-gender work environments and make within-gender comparisons across these three contexts. Data was collected using the Developmental Leadership Questionnaire from a sample of Swedish leadership course participants (N = 1897). Female leaders rated themselves more favorably than male leaders in female- dominated and mixed-gender work environments. Only small gender differences were found in male-dominated settings. Women in female dominated and gender-mixed work environments reported more favorable self-ratings than women in male dominated contexts. Among male leaders, fewer differences were observed between different work environments. The results are discussed in terms of organizational culture, individual selection preferences and a rapidly growing proportion of women leaders in the Swedish labor market.
