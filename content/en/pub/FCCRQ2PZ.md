    <h1>About</h1>
    Haugen et al. conducted a study on vitamin D levels in Nepalese mothers and their infants. They found that while a high percentage of mothers had insufficient or deficient vitamin D levels, their infants generally had adequate levels. Specifically, only 3.6% of infants had insufficient vitamin D, and just 0.6% were deficient, compared to 59.8% and 14.0% of mothers, respectively. The study identified that infant age and maternal vitamin D levels were key factors influencing infant vitamin D status. Additionally, maternal vitamin D levels were influenced by factors such as global solar radiation, maternal age, and body mass index (BMI). These findings highlight the importance of maternal health and environmental factors in ensuring adequate vitamin D levels in infants.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background: Describing vitamin D status and its predictors in various populations is important in order to target public health measures. Objectives: To describe the status and predictors of vitamin D status in healthy Nepalese mothers and infants. Methods: 500 randomly selected Nepalese mother and infant pairs were included in a cross-sectional study. Plasma 25(OH)D concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS and multiple linear regression analyses were used to identify predictors of vitamin D status. Results: Among the infants, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (25(OH)D 50 nmol/L) and deficiency (30 nmol/L) were 3.6% and 0.6%, respectively, in contrast to 59.8% and 14.0% among their mothers. Infant 25(OH)D concentrations were negatively associated with infant age and positively associated with maternal vitamin D status and body mass index (BMI), explaining 22% of the variability in 25(OH)D concentration. Global solar radiation, maternal age and BMI predicted maternal 25(OH)D concentration, explaining 9.7% of its variability. Conclusion: Age and maternal vitamin D status are the main predictors of vitamin D status in infants in Bhaktapur, Nepal, who have adequate vitamin D status despite poor vitamin D status in their mothers.
