    <h1>About</h1>
    Bjerck and colleagues have written a book that offers 50 different methods to study how people interact with their wardrobes and clothing. This practical guide goes beyond just looking at what people buy; it explores how they use, feel about, and relate to their clothes in everyday life. The methods include visual observations, touch-based techniques, conversations, collaborative activities, and even gym sessions. Contributions come from various regions and both academic and non-academic sources. The book aims to create a more inclusive and holistic understanding of fashion, emphasizing sustainability and diverse experiences. This work is important because it helps designers and researchers understand real-life clothing habits, potentially leading to more thoughtful and sustainable fashion practices.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This book presents a unique collection of 50 methods for exploring the actions, relationships and material contents of wardrobes. Organised as a practical guide to gathering information about people and their clothing beyond the point of purchase, it includes visual, tactile and verbal methods and others which involve making together, loitering and a session in the gym. With contributions from four continents from both in- and outside academic circles, this book and the real lives of wearers of clothes that are its focus, create a powerful new narrative of a more diverse, resourceful, emancipatory and holistic fashion and clothing system. Kate Fletcher is a Research Professor at University of the Arts London exploring design for sustainability in fashion. Research Professor Ingun Grimstad Klepp works at Consumption Research Norway, sifo at Oslo and Akershus University College with consumption of clothing.
