    <h1>About</h1>
    Romani et al. conducted a study on how human resources professionals may unintentionally perpetuate discrimination through diversity initiatives. They found that when these initiatives are framed as benevolent, they can obscure the fact that they often reinforce existing inequalities. The study introduces the concept of "benevolent discrimination," which involves well-meaning efforts to help marginalized groups but does so in a way that treats them as inferior and expects them to fit into the current hierarchical structure. This type of discrimination is subtle and hard to recognize because it is seen as positive and supportive. The authors used a Swedish organization known for its diversity efforts to illustrate how such practices can maintain inequality based on class and ethnicity. This research highlights the need for more critical evaluation of diversity measures to ensure they truly promote equality.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This article contributes to critical diversity management studies by exploring how human resources professionals do not see that the diversity measures they initiate can contribute to the reproduction of inequalities. We argue that framing such practices as benevolent obscures the fact that they are discriminatory acts. Drawing on the concept of benevolent discrimination, we conceptualise it along three dimensions: (1) a well-intended effort to address discrimination within (2) a social relationship that constructs the others as inferior and in need of help, which is granted with (3) the expectation that they will accommodate into the existing hierarchical order. Benevolent discrimination is a subtle and structural form of discrimination that is difficult to see for those performing it, because it frames their action as positive, in solidarity with the (inferior) other who is helped, and within a hierarchical order that is taken for granted. We develop the concept of benevolent discrimination building on an in-depth qualitative case study of a Swedish organisation that is believed to be exemplary in its engagement in diversity management initiatives. The organisation is however swayed by an inequality regime based on the intersection of class and ethnicity. We argue that it is precisely because human resources professionals frame their actions as acts of benevolence that they cannot see how they take part in organisational discrimination.
