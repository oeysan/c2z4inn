    <h1>About</h1>
    Happell et al. explored the experiences of "Experts by Experience" who teach mental health nursing students. These experts, who have personal experience with mental health issues, shared their insights through interviews. The study found that while their involvement empowers them and enriches student learning, it also presents challenges. These challenges include the need to be constructive, time for reflection, support from nursing academics, emotional and practical support, maintaining personal boundaries, and adapting to the audience. The authors suggest that clear standards are necessary to ensure the integrity of this teaching method and avoid tokenism. This research highlights the importance of considering the perspectives of these experts to improve mental health education.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Expert by Experience involvement in mental health nursing education is increasing in popularity as a teaching technique. The emerging literature attests to its benefits in enriching the educational experience for students. Much less attention has been devoted to the experience from the perspective of the Experts themselves. To address this gap and ensure this important perspective is captured and considered, the aim of this paper is to present the perceptions and experiences of Experts by Experience in delivering an educational module to mental health nursing students. A qualitative exploratory approach was adopted, involving in-depth individual interviews with Experts by Experience who delivered a learning module to nursing students in Australia and Europe. Data were analysed thematically. Analysis produced two overarching themes: Empowerment, and Challenges. Challenges included six sub-themes: Being constructive, not just critical; Time to unpack and reflect; Need for co-production and support from nursing academics; Emotional and practical support; maintaining personal boundaries; and adapting to the audience. These findings make a significant contribution to a broader understanding of Expert by Experience involvement in mental health education. The use of standards to maintain integrity and avoid tokenism is recommended.
