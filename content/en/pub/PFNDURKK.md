    <h1>About</h1>
    Søberg and Müller conducted a study on how teacher educators in Norway adapted to digital teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in the subject of Food and Health. They interviewed eight educators and found that the shift to online teaching challenged their digital skills and teaching methods. Despite these challenges, the educators worked hard to maintain the quality of their instruction and even found opportunities for innovative teaching in digital environments. However, they faced difficulties in communication and building relationships with students, which were significant obstacles. The study suggests that these underlying challenges, rather than the pandemic itself, were the main barriers to personal and institutional innovation in education.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Several Norwegian universities implemented the digitization of all teaching in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study explores teacher educators’ experiences when teaching the subject of Food and Health under the pandemic. The data consisted of eight interviews with teacher educators and was thematically analysed. 
The pandemic has challenged teachers’ digital competencies and pedagogical practices in different ways and forced them to work hard to maintain quality in their teaching. The findings indicate it could be possible to conduct innovative teaching in digitized learning environments. Teacher educators spent a lot of time rethinking teaching practices pedagogically and professionally in new digital settings. Digital teaching can be challenging in terms of communication and relationships between teacher educator and students, and between students. Accordingly, it would appear that the underlying challenges have presented the most obstacles to personal and institutional innovation, not the coronavirus crisis itself.
