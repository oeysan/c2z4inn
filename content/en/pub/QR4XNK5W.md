    <h1>About</h1>
    Saloň et al. conducted a systematic review to understand how viral infections affect the tiny blood vessels in the eyes, which can reflect broader changes in the body's microcirculatory system. They analyzed 16 studies, including research on COVID-19, HIV, and other viruses like Dengue Fever. They found that viral infections often lead to inflammation, causing the small blood vessels in the retina to widen temporarily. In cases of long-term COVID-19 and HIV, chronic inflammation can narrow these vessels. This research highlights the potential of using retinal imaging to detect early signs of cardiovascular issues, which could help reduce serious health problems by catching them early. Continuous research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of this diagnostic tool.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Viral infection frequently affects the cardiovascular system, and vascular disturbances in patients can lead to health complications. One essential component of the cardiovascular system that is vulnerable to the inflammatory effects of viral infections is the microcirculatory system. As a suitable and practical non-invasive method to assess the structure and function of the retinal microcirculation, a proxy for the microcirculatory system, retinal fundus imaging can be used. We examined the impact of viral infections on retinal vessel diameters and performed a systematic analysis of the literature. Our search was carried out on PubMed using predefined search queries. After a methodological filtering process, we were able to reduce the corpus of 363 publications to 16 studies that met the search parameters. We used a narrative review style to summarise the observations. Six studies covered COVID-19, seven described HIV, and three were included in the subgroup called others, covering viruses, such as Dengue Fever and Crimean–Congo Haemorrhagic Fever. Analysis of the literature showed that viral infections are associated with alterations in the retinal vessels’ vasoactivity. COVID-19 and other infections cause inflammation-associated the vasodilatation of microvasculature as a short-term effect of the infection. Long COVID-19 as well as HIV are the cause of chronic inflammation impacting microvascular morphology via retinal vessel diameter narrowing. The review emphasises the importance of the understudied area of viral infections’ effects on retinal microcirculation. Continuous research in this area is needed to further verify retinal fundus imaging as an innovative tool for the optimal diagnosis of microvascular changes. As changes in the microvasculature precede changes in bigger arteries, the early detection of microvascular changes can go a long way in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases.
