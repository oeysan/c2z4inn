    <h1>About</h1>
    Larsson et al. conducted a study on Swedish military veterans to understand how daily positive experiences (uplifts), daily challenges (hassles), and coping styles affect their reintegration into work, family, and private life after returning from international missions. They found that frequent daily hassles and using escape-avoidance coping (avoiding problems rather than facing them) led to more difficulties in reintegration. Veterans who felt threatened during their last mission also struggled more. The study identified three distinct groups: "resilient and well-functioning" veterans who reintegrated well, "ambitious and struggling" veterans with moderate reintegration success, and "worried and avoidant" veterans who had the most trouble reintegrating. These findings help us understand the challenges veterans face and can inform better support strategies for their reintegration.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Our first aim was to explore the relationship between daily uplifts, daily hassles, and coping styles the first year after returning from international military missions and post-deployment work, family, and private reintegration in military veterans. Our second aim was to identify individual patterns regarding daily uplifts, daily hassles, and coping styles and to explore how they relate to the above-mentioned aspects of post-deployment reintegration. Questionnaire responses were received from 446 Swedish military veterans. Regression analyses showed that daily hassles and an escape-avoidance copingstyle made significant contributions in the predicted, negative direction to the amount of explained variance on reintegration indicator scales. A high level of perceived threat during the last mission also contributed to more negative integration. Using a person-centered approach, three unique profiles of response patterns were identified using a cluster analysis based on the uplift, hassles, and coping style scores. One profile was labeled “resilient and well-functioning”; its members showed favorable reintegration scores. A second profile was called “ambitious and struggling.” These individuals scored medium-high on the reintegration scales. The third profile consistently indicated the least favorable reintegration scores and was labeled “worried and avoidant.” The results confirm and deepen our existing knowledge.
