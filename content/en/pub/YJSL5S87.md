    <h1>About</h1>
    Drozdzowicz and Phillips explore how we understand language in everyday situations, like reading news or chatting with friends. They examine two main ideas: the perceptual approach, which suggests we understand language by perceiving its meaning directly, and the inferential approach, which proposes we infer meaning from context and clues. This paper clarifies these concepts and discusses philosophical debates about how we process language, including the psychological and experiential aspects. It also touches on epistemology, which is the study of knowledge, and how understanding language fits into this field. By examining these approaches, the authors aim to shed light on the complex nature of linguistic understanding, which is crucial for effective communication in daily life.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Consider reading the news about the recent election, taking part in a classroom discussion about injustice, or having a conversation about dinner, with your friend. In these cases, you rely on your capacity for linguistic understanding. How do we come to understand what other people communicate to us on particular occasions? In recent philosophical debates about this question, we find two broad approaches: the perceptual approach, which claims that we come to understand an utterance by employing broadly perceptual capacities to perceive or quasi-perceive the utterance’s meaning; and the inferential approach, which claims that we come to understand an utterance by employing broadly inferential capacities to infer what is being conveyed by an utterance. This paper focuses on the debates concerning these two approaches. We provide conceptual and methodological clarifications regarding linguistic understanding and introduce some of the key philosophical debates concerning its nature, including those concerning its phenomenology and underlying psychology, with a focus on the role of perception and inference. We also discuss some epistemological questions concerning the understanding of linguistic utterances and different views that try to explain its epistemological role(s). This paper is an introduction to the special issue ‘Linguistic Understanding: Perception and Inference’.
