    <h1>About</h1>
    Weydahl and Calogiuri conducted a study on the physical demands faced by mushers (dog sled drivers) in the Finnmarksløpet, Europe's longest dog-sled race in Norway. They measured the mushers' maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and heart rates before and during the race. The results showed that mushers have higher VO2 max levels compared to non-athletes, indicating better cardiovascular fitness. During the race, mushers' heart rates varied between 38% and 76% of their maximum heart rate, with the highest rates occurring in the first 200km. Mushers in the shorter 500km race had higher heart rates than those in the 1000km race. Additionally, experienced mushers felt less exertion as the race progressed, while less experienced mushers felt more tired. This study highlights the intense physical effort required in dog-sled racing.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This paper describes a series of studies on mushers (overall n= 33) who participated in the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 endurance dog sled race Finnmarksløpet (FL), in the northern part of Norway. The race, which includes two classes, 500km and 1000km, goes through several checkpoints (CPs) placed four to ten hours apart. The participants’ maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and maximal heart rates (HRmax) were assessed prior to the race. During the race the participants’ HR were recorded using Polar ® watches. In the 2008 study, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) using the 6-20 Borg scale were recorded in two female mushers when entering the CPs. The results show a higher VO2 max for the mushers compared to non-athletic men and women. The mushers had a mean working HR ranging between 38% and 76% of HRmax. For most mushers the mean HR at the different legs are between 65% and 55 % of HRmax. All mushers showed the highest mean HR during the first 200km of the race. The analysis of the legs that have the same trail for the two classes showed that the mushers participating in the 500km race had a higher mean HR than the mushers participating in the 1000km. The findings on RPE indicate that a more experienced mushers reported decreasing RPE during the race, while a less experienced mushers reported increasing RPE. Key words: Mushers, exercise, intensity
