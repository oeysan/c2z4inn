    <h1>About</h1>
    Firth et al. conducted a study to explore how mindfulness affects self-efficacy, pain perception, stress, and academic performance in university students. They found that self-efficacy, which is the belief in one's ability to succeed, positively impacted students' well-being and academic performance. The study involved 92 participants and included three parts: measuring traits related to pain and well-being, exposing participants to stress tasks, and testing the effects of a short mindfulness intervention. While mindfulness helped reduce stress and improve well-being in the long term, it surprisingly decreased self-efficacy after the intervention. These findings suggest that while mindfulness can be beneficial for managing stress and improving overall well-being, its impact on self-efficacy and academic performance may vary.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Purpose: This study seeks to understand the mediating effects of mindfulness on selfefficacy, academic performance and ability to cope with pain. It further examines the effect of mindfulness on the capacity to cope with pain-induced stress. Whilst there are physiological changes which occur due to mindfulness, it is still not clearly understood how the mechanisms behind mindfulness work or whether the role of self-efficacy is an agent of mindfulness which may impact on performance and stress coping. 
Participants and methods: A three-part study (n=92) was conducted to test the relationship between mindfulness, self-efficacy and well-being factors, alongside academic performance in university students. Part one involved data collection one month prior to an experiment where trait scores for all factors were used to check pain and well-being behaviors. Part two consisted of participant randomization into three intervention groups(control, sham, mindfulness) and then an exposure to a fear induction task followed by cognitive tasks. The third part consisted of investigating the effect of a short mindfulness intervention on self-efficacy, pain and well-being in students. 
Results: The results indicate that self-efficacy had a positive effect on well-being factor (study 1 & 3) and in the experiment (study 2). 
Conclusion: Self-efficacy influenced pain intensity and pain unpleasantness and significantly predicted academic performance. Mindfulness had mixed results in how it influenced self-efficacy. While it influenced well-being and lowered stress (study 1 & 2) in the long term, the mindfulness intervention significantly decreased self efficacy.
