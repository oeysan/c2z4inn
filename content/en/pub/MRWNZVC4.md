    <h1>About</h1>
    Barker et al. explore a new approach to physical education that focuses on improving students' movement skills. They argue that current teaching models don't fully address the concept of "human practising," which is about self-improvement through physical activity. The authors propose a model that includes specific learning outcomes, teaching strategies, and five key activities to help students enhance their movement capabilities. They believe this model can revitalize physical education by making it more relevant to students' lives and broader physical cultures. The paper also discusses how this model can help students transfer skills, achieve excellence, and understand social and cultural aspects of physical activity. This study aims to make physical education more effective and meaningful for students.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background: Physical educators currently have a number of pedagogical (or curricular) models at their disposal. While existing models have been well-received in educational contexts, these models seek to extend students’ capacities within a limited number of ‘human activities’ (Arendt, 1958). The activity of human practising, which is concerned with the improvement of the self, is not explicitly dealt with by current models. 
 
Purpose: The aim of the paper is to outline how a model of human practising related to movement capability could be enacted in physical education. 
 
Findings: Building on a theoretical exposition of human practising presented in a separate paper, this paper provides a practically oriented discussion related to: (1) the general learning outcomes as well as teaching and learning strategies of the model; (2) an outline of five activities that describe how the model could be implemented; and (3) the non-negotiable features of the model. 
 
Discussion: The model’s potential contribution to the ongoing revitalization of PE as an institutionalized educational practice is discussed. Points concerning how the model relates to wider physical cultures, its position regarding transfer of learning, standards of excellence, and social and cultural transmission are considered. 
 
Conclusion: The paper is concluded with some reflections on pedagogical models generally and how they relate to the pedagogical model of practising movement capability presented in this paper.
