    <h1>About</h1>
    Sagheim explores how legitimacy affects the growth of the sharing economy, specifically Airbnb, in Innlandet, Norway. They conducted interviews with consumers, Airbnb hosts, established businesses, and regional policymakers. The study found that Airbnb faces legitimacy issues due to unclear regulations and norms, leading to economic losses for the region and reduced local benefits. These findings suggest that the sharing economy is not fully accepted by key stakeholders, which hinders its development. Understanding how legitimacy and delegitimation (the process of undermining legitimacy) impact new industries can help policymakers and businesses navigate challenges and foster growth. This research highlights the importance of clear regulations and local value creation in gaining acceptance for new economic paths.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The development of the tourism industry in regional contexts has attracted significant interest from tourism geographers, in which the evolutionary economic geography (EEG) approach has been of interest over the last decade. Recent research on EEG has emphasised the role of institutions and particularly legitimacy in new path development, claiming that legitimacy is crucial for the development of emerging industries. Against this backdrop, this paper explores the role of legitimation and delegitimation in the development of the sharing economy in Innlandet, a tourism region in Norway. The article poses two research questions. How is the legitimacy of Airbnb expressed by key tourism stakeholders in a tourism region in Norway? Moreover, how can the shifting roles of legitimation and delegitimation among key stakeholders in the tourism industry inform the literature on new path development? These issues are explored in qualitative interviews with respondents from four key tourism stakeholder groups: consumers, Airbnb hosts, incumbent firms, and regional industry and policy actors. The findings reveal legitimacy issues mainly related to regulatory and normative ambiguities, described by biased regulations that result in economic leakages to other regions and countries and concerns about decreasing local value creation in the region. These findings indicate that the sharing economy lacks legitimacy among the stakeholders. The article concerns the role of legitimation and delegitimation in new path development processes, arguing that delegitimation prevents transformative changes and path development processes.
