    <h1>About</h1>
    Miettinen et al. conducted a study to understand how music teacher programs in Israel and Finland prepare educators for cultural diversity. They interviewed music teacher educators from two institutions to map out the intercultural skills needed and provided by these programs. The educators could describe their own intercultural abilities but struggled to explain how their programs teach these skills to students. The study highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to intercultural competence in music education and suggests that educators should collaborate to form "knowledge communities" to better address these issues. This research is important because it can help improve how future music teachers are trained to handle diverse cultural backgrounds in their classrooms.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Societies worldwide are becoming more aware of the educational challenges that come with increased cultural diversity derived from ethnic, linguistic, religious, socioeconomic and educational differences and their intersections. In many countries, teacher education programmes are expected to prepare teachers for this reality and develop their intercultural competences. This instrumental case study is based on a project that aims to initiate mobilizing networks between two music teacher programmes to explore intercultural music teacher education. In this study, we map the intercultural competences that are required of music teacher educators and that are provided in the music education programmes at two higher music education institutions in Israel and Finland. The data consists of 11 focus group interviews with music teacher educators at the Levinsky College of Education in Tel Aviv and the Sibelius Academy of the University of the Arts Helsinki, conducted by a multinational research team. The data was analysed abductively, using content analysis as a method. While the interviewed teacher educators could articulate many aspects of their own intercultural competences or the lack of them, the findings indicate that in musical diversity and teaching students from different musical backgrounds the teacher educators found it difficult to explain what kinds of intercultural competences their respective programmes provided for the students. Based on the findings, there is a need for a more holistic understanding of intercultural competences in music teacher education as well as how our institutions produce power. There is also a need for the teacher educators in the programmes to collaborate and discuss among each other in order to create “knowledge communities” and to move towards addressing intercultural issues.
