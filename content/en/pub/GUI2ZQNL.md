    <h1>About</h1>
    Fried and Singhal explore why organizations sometimes intentionally deviate from established standards, despite the potential risks to safety and quality. Their book uses structuration theory, which examines both the structures within organizations and the actions of individuals, to understand the conditions that lead to such deviance. They argue that deviations are not just the result of individual misbehavior but are influenced by broader organizational factors. Through case studies of software development companies, they show how standards serve as tools for making sense of situations, allocating resources, and enforcing rules. This research helps us rethink corporate responsibility and understand the complex reasons behind why organizations might choose to ignore standards, even in an environment focused on audits and accountability.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Standards have become widespread regulatory tools that promote global trade, innovation, efficiency, and quality. They contribute significantly to the creation of safe, reliable, and high-quality services and technologies to ensure human health, environmental protection, or information security. Yet intentional deviations from standards by organizations are often reported in many sectors, which can either contribute to or challenge the measures of safety and quality they are designed to safeguard. Why then, despite all potential consequences, do organizations choose to deviate from standards in one way or another? This book uses structuration theory—covering aspects of both structure and agency—to explore the organizational conditions and contradictions under which different types of deviance occur. It also provides empirical explanations for deviance in organizations that go beyond an understanding of individual misbehaviour where mainly a single person is held responsible. Case studies of software developing organizations illustrate insightful generalizations on standards as a mechanism of sensemaking, resource allocation, and sanctioning, and provide ground to rethink corporate responsibility when deviating from standards in the ‘audit society’.
