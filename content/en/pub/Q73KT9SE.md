    <h1>About</h1>
    Mølster's study explores how digital tools, known as Information and Communication Technology (ICT), can assist students who have difficulties with reading and writing. These skills are essential, so schools and teachers need effective strategies to support struggling students. The research, part of the Norwegian SPEED project, gathered data from students, teachers, and parents about the use of computers in regular and special education for grades 5 to 9. The study found that ICT is not widely used in everyday school activities for these students. However, both teachers and students believe that ICT is very helpful as a compensatory tool, meaning it can help make up for their difficulties. This study highlights the need for better integration of digital tools in classrooms to support students with learning challenges.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The question we ask in this paper is what role digital tools play for students who struggle with reading and writing difficulties. Being able to read and write are basic skills. Therefore, it is important that the school and the teachers do what they can to help these students. We know that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can be a valuable tool for learners with various kinds of disabilities. This is especially true for students who struggle with reading and writing. However, it seems that digital technology used to compensate for different learning impairments has not reached the classroom to a full extent. This paper is based on findings in the Norwegian research project The Function of Special Education (the SPEED project). The project has collected a broad range of empirical data from students, teachers and parents on level 5 to 9, including data on the use of computers in both the ordinary teaching and special education. A key finding is that ICT seems to play a modest role in everyday schoolwork for students with reading and writing difficulties. On the other hand, we find that both teachers and students report that ICT is very useful as a compensatory or alternative tool for this group of students. The paper will attempt to explain this apparent contradiction.
