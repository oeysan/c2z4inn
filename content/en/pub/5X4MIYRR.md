    <h1>About</h1>
    Snipstad explores how inclusive education can challenge traditional ideas about "normal" and "deviant" students. They argue that schools should focus on meeting the needs of all students rather than categorizing them into specific groups. Using the example of a boy named Bruno, who is diagnosed with an intellectual disability, the study examines how he perceives himself and his actions based on societal descriptions. The authors suggest that when schools have high expectations and ambitions for all students, including those with disabilities, it can positively impact their educational experience and help them meet societal standards. This research highlights the importance of inclusive practices in education to support every learner's potential.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Inclusion entered the discourse of education in order to challenge the conceptions of the normal and the deviant pupil. A socially oriented inclusive discourse implies that schools should not focus their attention on certain defined groups of pupils but instead on how educational institutions themselves are able to meet the needs of all learners. Drawing on philosopher Ian Hacking, this article focuses on the category ‘intellectual disability’ and how those categorised as such construct themselves, their behaviour and actions in relation to the descriptions available to them in their surroundings. Based on empirical data gathered from a boy (Bruno) diagnosed as intellectually disabled, this article discusses how an education that meets learners with high ambitions and expectations in relation to their educational potential may affect the pupil in ways that are enabling in relation to normative demands of education and society at large.
