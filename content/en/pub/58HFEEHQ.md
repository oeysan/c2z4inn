    <h1>About</h1>
    Tinkov et al. conducted a study to explore the link between aluminium levels in hair and urine and obesity in people not exposed to aluminium at work. They examined 411 participants, half of whom were obese. The researchers found that obese individuals had significantly higher aluminium levels in their hair and urine compared to lean individuals. Despite this, conditions like hypertension, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in obese patients were not directly linked to aluminium levels. The study suggests that higher aluminium levels are associated with increased body weight, but it does not establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship. Further research is needed to understand how aluminium exposure might affect obesity and related health issues.

    Background 
Data on the association between aluminium (Al) exposure and obesity and/or metabolic syndrome are insufficient. The objective of the present study was to investigate the association between hair and urine Al levels and obesity. 
 
Methods 
A total of 206 lean and 205 obese non-occupationally exposed subjects (30–50 y.o.) were enrolled in the study. Hair and urine Al levels were assessed with ICP-MS. Laboratory quality control was performed using the certified reference materials of human hair, plasma, and urine. 
 
Results 
Hair and urinary Al levels in obese subjects were significantly higher by 31% and 46% compared to the control levels, respectively. The presence of hypertension (41% cases), atherosclerosis (8%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (10%), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (53%) in obese patients were not associated with Al levels in the studied subjects. An overall multiple regression model established urinary Al levels (β = 0.395; p < 0.001), hypertension (β = 0.331; p < 0.001) and NAFLD (β = 0.257; p = 0.003) were significantly and directly associated with BMI. Hair Al levels were found to be border-line significantly related to BMI after adjustment for several confounders (β = −0.205; p = 0.054). 
 
Conclusions 
Aluminium body burden is associated with increased body weight, although the causal relationship between Al exposure and obesity is not clear. Both clinical and experimental studies are required to further investigate the impact of Al exposure on metabolic parameters in obesity and especially direct effects of Al in adipose tissue.
