    <h1>About</h1>
    Ohlsson et al. conducted a study to understand how personality traits and political skills influence team performance in a multinational military staff exercise. They focused on the Big Five personality dimensions, which include traits like emotional stability, and political skill, which is the ability to navigate social situations effectively. The study involved 185 military staff officers and found that emotional stability and political skill had a small but significant impact on how well teams performed. This finding is important because it suggests that improving these soft skills could enhance teamwork and overall performance in military settings. The authors also provided practical advice and suggested areas for future research to further explore these relationships.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Military staffs are composed of many smaller teams that are interdependent upon each other for a positive functioning level of the whole staff. Many factors can improve or harm the harmony of the staff. Recently, there has been an increased interest in the soft factors that may affect team performance. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the Big Five personality dimensions, political skill and perceived team performance in a multinational staff training event. The sample included 185 military staff officers (49% response rate). The results indicated that the personality dimension Emotional stability and Political skill had a limited, yet statistically significant, predictive power on team performance. Practical considerations and future research directions are suggested.
