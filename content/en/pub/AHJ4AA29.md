    <h1>About</h1>
    Zimova et al. studied Arctic foxes in Sweden to understand how they adapt their fur color to changing snow conditions. They found that foxes in colder, northern areas changed their fur color earlier in autumn and later in spring compared to those in warmer areas. During colder, snowier years, all foxes changed their fur color earlier in autumn and later in spring. White foxes blended well with snowy backgrounds, while blue (brown) foxes stood out against the snow. Despite this mismatch, blue foxes did not seem to face extra risks. The authors suggest that as snow cover decreases, having more blue foxes might help the species survive. This study highlights how animals might adapt to climate change through changes in fur color timing and frequency.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Species that seasonally moult from brown to white to match snowy backgrounds become conspicuous and experience increased predation risk as snow cover duration declines. Long-term adaptation to camouflage mismatch in a changing climate might occur through phenotypic plasticity in colour moult phenology and or evolutionary shifts in moult rate or timing. Also, adaptation may include evolutionary shifts towards winter brown phenotypes that forgo the winter white moult. Most studies of these processes have occurred in winter white populations, with little attention to polymorphic populations with sympatric winter brown and winter white morphs. Here, we used remote camera traps to record moult phenology and mismatch in two polymorphic populations of Arctic foxes in Sweden over 2 years. We found that the colder, more northern population moulted earlier in the autumn and later in the spring. Next, foxes moulted earlier in the autumn and later in the spring during colder and snowier years. Finally, white foxes experienced relatively low camouflage mismatch while blue foxes were mismatched against snowy backgrounds most of the autumn through the spring. Because the brown-on-white mismatch imposes no evident costs, we predict that as snow duration decreases, increasing blue morph frequencies might help facilitate species persistence.
