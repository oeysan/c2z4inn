    <h1>About</h1>
    Naha et al. conducted a study published in the journal "Animals" examining how people perceive grey wolves across different countries. They reviewed 118 studies from 35 countries, spanning from 1980 to 2023. The findings show that perceptions of wolves vary significantly based on economic status and religion. In general, people in low-income countries tend to view wolves negatively. In Asia, negative perceptions are common, especially in countries where Hinduism is prevalent. Conversely, in Europe and North America, perceptions are more positive, particularly in Western Europe and Slavic Russian regions. The study suggests that understanding these social factors is crucial for developing strategies to promote coexistence between humans and wolves, especially in central Europe, parts of Asia, and Russia.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Effective conservation of large mammals depends on how people perceive them. Grey wolves have a widespread distribution globally, and their recent recolonization of human-dominated landscapes offers an excellent opportunity to understand the heterogeneity in their perception across continents. Our analysis included all quantitative studies (118 articles) conducted in 35 countries through a systematic review process, published globally between 1980–2023 and indexed in Web of Science and Google Scholar. Fifty-four percent of the studies reported a negative perception toward wolves. Most studies conducted in Asia reported a negative perception, while 56% of studies conducted in Europe and 48% in North America reported a positive perception. Fifty-four percent of studies from Western Europe and forty percent of studies from Slavic Russian cultural regions reported positive perceptions. Respondents from low-income countries elicited the most negative perceptions. We identified the predominant religion and economic status of a country as dominant factors determining perception. Studies conducted in countries with Hinduism as the predominant religion reported a negative perception toward wolves. We recommend that future studies on human–wolf interactions must prioritize regions within central Europe, parts of Asia, and Russia. A global human–wolf coexistence strategy should consider the social factors driving attitude toward the species.
