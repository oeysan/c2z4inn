    <h1>About</h1>
    Wangensteen and Westby conducted in-depth interviews with five young people who grew up with parents suffering from substance use disorder (SUD). They aimed to understand what factors helped protect and support these children despite their challenging circumstances. The study found that safe living conditions, meaningful relationships, and respectful, caring conversations with professionals were crucial protective factors. These elements helped the young people navigate their difficult childhoods and maintain their mental health and social relationships. The authors analyzed the stories using a narrative approach, which looks at how people make sense of their experiences. This research highlights the importance of providing stable environments and supportive interactions for children in similar situations, emphasizing the role of community and professional support in fostering resilience.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    There are expectations for parents to provide their children with emotional, social and economic security and predictability. Parents with a substance use disorder (SUD) are often unable to meet the norms and expectations of good parenting, and their children are vulnerable to developing problems with mental health, social relationships and substance use. Through in-depth interviews, the authors explored five young people’s stories about protection factors during their childhood around parents with SUD. The interviews were analysed using a narrative approach in accordance with Polkinghorne’s concept of the paradigmatic analysis of narrative data. In the informants’ stories about their childhood, safe living conditions, significant relationships and respectful and caring conversations with professionals were interpreted as important protective and supportive factors. The findings are discussed within sociocultural theories about parenthood, family life, and how people create meaning from and coherence of experiences and events through narratives.
