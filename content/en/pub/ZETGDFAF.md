    <h1>About</h1>
    Drugli et al. conducted a study to understand how toddlers adapt to childcare by examining their cortisol levels, a stress indicator, and gathering perceptions from parents and professional caregivers. They collected saliva samples from 113 toddlers and qualitative notes from 87 parents and 101 caregivers during the first month and after three months in childcare. The findings showed that toddlers initially experienced stress when separated from their parents, reflected in higher cortisol levels and observations of tiredness and exhaustion. However, after three months, cortisol levels decreased, and both parents and caregivers noted improved well-being. This study highlights the importance of providing emotional support to toddlers during their transition to childcare to help them adapt more comfortably.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Introduction: Enrolling in childcare represents the first transition in toddlers’ lives and lays the foundation for their well-being in childcare centers going forward. 
Child cortisol levels may be an indicator of how toddlers themselves experience their introduction to childcare. In the present study, we  explored changes in 
toddler cortisol levels during their first month in childcare and at a 3-month follow-up, as well as the perceptions of parents and professional caregivers regarding the toddlers’ settling-in process during the same period. Method: This study used a mixed-method design. Saliva samples were collected 
from 113 toddlers and their cortisol levels analyzed. Qualitative notes were collected from parents (n = 87) and professional caregivers (n = 101). The data were analyzed using linear mixed model and thematic analyses, respectively. 
Results: Changes in toddler cortisol levels and their parents’ and professional caregivers’ perceptions of the transition process fit well. Both data sources 
indicated an easy start in childcare when parents were present, while the first weeks separated from parents seemed quite demanding. After 3 months, the cortisol levels returned to a low level, while child well-being was perceived as high. 
Discussion: Toddlers need time to adapt to childcare settings. Even if they are 
well taken care of by their keyworkers during the day, many toddlers are tired and exhausted in the evenings at home, particularly in the first weeks of separation from their parents. Both professional caregivers and parents should be aware of toddlers’ need for emotional support during their transition to childcare.
