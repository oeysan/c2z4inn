    <h1>About</h1>
    Bachmann et al. conducted a study examining wildlife hunting across Africa and Europe, focusing on differences and similarities between regions with varying levels of development. They found that in less developed areas (Global South), hunting is often illegal and driven by economic needs, targeting herbivores. In more developed areas (Global North), hunting is typically legal and motivated by social and ecological reasons, focusing on ungulates within parks, while illegal hunting targets predators outside parks. Common issues include increased conflict-related killings in populated areas and reduced illegal hunting when communities are involved in managing protected areas. The study suggests that while local conditions help, the level of development significantly impacts hunting practices. Collaborative efforts are needed for effective wildlife conservation across regions.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Hunting and its impacts on wildlife are typically studied regionally, with a particular focus on the Global South. Hunting can, however, also undermine rewilding efforts or threaten wildlife in the Global North. Little is known about how hunting manifests under varying socioeconomic and ecological contexts across the Global South and North. Herein, we examined differences and commonalities in hunting characteristics across an exemplary Global South-North gradient approximated by the Human Development Index (HDI) using face-to-face interviews with 114 protected area (PA) managers in 25 African and European countries. Generally, we observed that hunting ranges from the illegal, economically motivated, and unsustainable hunting of herbivores in the South to the legal, socially and ecologically motivated hunting of ungulates within parks and the illegal hunting of mainly predators outside parks in the North. Commonalities across this Africa-Europe South-North gradient included increased conflict-related killings in human-dominated landscapes and decreased illegal hunting with beneficial community conditions, such as mutual trust resulting from community involvement in PA management. Nevertheless, local conditions cannot outweigh the strong effect of the HDI on unsustainable hunting. Our findings highlight regional challenges that require collaborative, integrative efforts in wildlife conservation across actors, while identified commonalities may outline universal mechanisms for achieving this goal.
