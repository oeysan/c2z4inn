    <h1>About</h1>
    Drożdżowicz explores how we use language in different ways and suggests that understanding these varied forms can impact philosophical discussions about language. They argue that language should not just be seen as an abstract concept but as something we experience in many different ways. By examining different methods of communication, Drożdżowicz believes we can better understand debates about the nature of words, language, and how we comprehend linguistic expressions. This study highlights the importance of considering the diverse ways we engage with language to deepen our understanding of philosophical issues related to communication. This approach can help clarify how we interpret and relate to the words and messages we encounter in everyday life.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    As an object of philosophical study, language is typically considered as an abstract 
object rather than a lived phenomenon that comes with rich and varied phenomenology. 
And yet our modes of engaging with language are complex and many. The first goal 
of this paper is to illustrate this variety by looking at some of the linguistic modalities 
and forms of communication. The second goal is to suggest that at least in some 
specific philosophical debates, language and communication should be investigated 
in the context of the various linguistic modalities and forms of communication. This 
will be done by considering how attention to some of the linguistic modalities and 
forms of communication may affect philosophical debates concerning: the nature of 
words, language and linguistic understanding, as well as the relation between linguistic 
utterances and their sources.
