    <h1>About</h1>
    Kirchner and Mostert conducted a study on the reading habits and motivations of 402 Namibian primary school students. They found that these students, who were taught in English and attended schools with good access to reading resources, showed high motivation to read but engaged in moderate reading activity. Unlike their North American peers, these students read more for pleasure than for academic purposes and preferred print over digital texts. Factors like curiosity and the importance of reading for grades motivated them. While motivation was linked to reading activity and achievement, there was no significant connection between reading activity and academic success. These insights could help improve teaching strategies in Namibia, making them more effective and inclusive.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This paper reports on the reading motivation and reading activity of 402, urban, Namibian learners in 6 schools in the central region of Namibia. From the fourth grade these Grade 7 learners received their instruction through the medium of English, and offered English as Second Language in addition to another Namibian language. They were enrolled in schools that performed above-average in the Namibian Standardised Achievement Test for English language and with reasonable access to reading resources. Employing adapted formats of instruments, developed by John T. Guthrie and colleagues, the relationships between various aspects of reading motivation, reading activity and achievement, as well as gender differences, were explored. Different from early adolescent readers in North America, the group showed moderate reading activity and high levels of motivation. Learners reported that they read slightly more often for pleasure than for academic purposes, and read fewer texts in digital than print format. Recognising the multifaceted nature of motivation, this study revealed that aspects, such as curiosity about specific topics, the importance of reading and reading for grades, were factors that highly motivated these Namibian learners. Positive relationships between motivation and reading activity, as well as between reading motivation and reading achievement, were established. Contrary to expectations, no statistically relevant correlation between academic achievement and reading activity was found. Relationships between these variables and gender, though modest, corroborate findings from previous research. These results may prove valuable in further research regarding the development of effective and inclusive classroom practices in the Namibian context.
