    <h1>About</h1>
    Roth and Stuedahl conducted a study on two young Norwegian ethnic-minority girls transitioning from lower to upper secondary school. They examined how these girls use their social networks and resources to navigate their educational paths and everyday lives. The study focused on "social gendered positional identities," which means how their gender and cultural background influence their choices and actions. By following the girls over two years, the authors created detailed biographical cases showing how cultural factors impact learning in specific contexts. They found that the girls' gendered positions and educational choices are closely linked, and reflecting on personal identity can help students make informed decisions about their future. This research highlights the importance of understanding cultural and gender influences in education.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This article describes two young Norwegian ethnic-minority girls in their efforts to involve social networks and to position themselves as learners in the transition between lower and upper secondary school. The article explores how they experience future possibilities represented by education and how they use resources in negotiating their everyday lives. We use the concept of social gendered positional identities to study how educational choices are individually and collectively formed and enacted in these girls’ everyday figured worlds. The study builds on ethnographic data collected by following two classmates across multiple settings over two years. We develop biographical cases to demonstrate how cultural factors relevant to learning emerged in particular contexts. The article concludes that gendered positions and choices made in educational transitions are connected and that meta-reflections on personal identity can help students to make decisions about the future.
