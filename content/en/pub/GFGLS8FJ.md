    <h1>About</h1>
    Lien et al. conducted a study to understand how risk management affects the productivity of organic rice farmers in India. They used a special model to analyze how different types of risk, such as farmers' attitudes toward risk and their risk management skills, impact productivity. The study found that farmers who were very cautious and risk-averse had lower productivity compared to those who were less worried about risks. Interestingly, farmers who were most concerned about specific production risks like weather and pests actually had higher productivity. Additionally, the study suggests that increasing farm size can help reduce production costs. These findings are important because they show how managing risk can directly influence the success and efficiency of farming practices.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This study analyzes the effects of farmers’ risk on productivity where the production function is generalized to be specific to risk variables. This resulted in a semiparametric smooth-coefficient (SPSC) production function. The novelty of the SPSC approach is that it can explain the direct and indirect channels through which risk can affect productivity. The study uses several measures of risk, including attitudes toward risk, perceptions of risk, and risk management skills of farmers. It then shows how these risk-related variables affect productivity both directly and indirectly via the inputs. Using 2015 farm-level data from organic basmati rice (OBR) smallholders in India, the study finds that OBR farmers with high degrees of risk aversion had lower productivity than less risk-averse or risk-neutral OBR farmers. Additionally, OBR farmers who were most concerned about production risks (i.e., weather and pest risks) had higher productivity than their counterparts. Finally, the study reveals that OBR farmers can reduce production costs by increasing farm size.
