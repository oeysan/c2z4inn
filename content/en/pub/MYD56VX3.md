    <h1>About</h1>
    Mikkilä et al. conducted a study to explore whether leisure time physical activity can help prevent vertebral fractures, which are common and serious bone injuries. They analyzed data from a long-term population study in Norway, involving over 1900 adults. Participants' physical activity levels were assessed through questionnaires, and their vertebral fractures were checked using x-ray scans. The researchers found no significant link between physical activity and reduced risk of vertebral fractures, even after considering factors like age, weight, and smoking. This suggests that being active in your free time might not be enough to prevent these types of fractures. The authors recommend future studies to use more precise measures of physical activity and track new cases of vertebral fractures.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Introduction: Vertebral fractures are common osteoporotic fractures, affecting 2–46% of the population, causing 
morbidity and increased risk of mortality. Physical activity has beneficial effects for bone health, including increased 
bone mineral density and reduced hip fractures. However, evidence concerning prevention of vertebral fractures is 
scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between leisure time physical activity and 
vertebral fracture risk. 
Methods: The data were retrieved from the 2001 and 2007–2008 surveys of the Tromsø Study, a longitudinal 
population study in Norway. A total of 1904 participants (1030 women and 874 men, age 38–87 yr and 40–87 yr 
respectively) were included in the cross-sectional analysis (2007–2008). Prospective follow-up data (2001 to 2007) on 
physical activity were available for 1131 participants (636 women and 495 men, age 32–69 yr and 33–69 yr 
respectively). Physical activity was assessed by a questionnaire and vertebral fracture by lateral vertebral fracture 
assessment from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans. Logistic regression was used to examine associations 
between physical activity and vertebral fracture. 
Results: After controlling for confounders (age, height, weight, smoking, osteoporosis, osteoporosis medication, left 
hip total bone mineral density, and use of hormones in women only), no cross-sectional associations between 
physical activity levels and vertebral fracture were observed, OR 1.13 (95% CI: 0.59–2.13), for moderately active 
women and 1.44 (0.61–3.42) for highly active women, compared with sedentary women. In men, the respective 
ORs were 1.74 (95% CI: 0.91–3.35) and 1.64 (0.78–3.41). In the prospective analyses, OR for vertebral fracture in 
women with reduced physical activity was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.18–3.62), 1.24 (95% CI: 0.29–5.26) for increased physical 
activity and 1.54 (95% CI: 0.43–5.50) for active unchanged physical activity pattern, compared with sedentary 
unchanged physical activity. In men, the respective ORs were 2.05 (95% CI: 0.57–7.42), 2.23 (95% CI: 0.63–7.87), and 
1.81 (95% CI: 0.54–6.02). Subanalyses of women and men ≥50 yr showed similar results. 
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that physical activity does not play a major role in preventing vertebral fractures 
in Norwegian adults. Future studies may benefit from data on incident vertebral fracture, and objectively measured 
physical activity.
