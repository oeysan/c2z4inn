    <h1>About</h1>
    Yu et al. conducted a study to understand how climate change and changes in tree distribution will affect the diversity and distribution of macrofungi (large fungi) across Europe. They used data from 1845 macrofungal species in eight European countries to create models predicting future scenarios. The study found that if only climate change is considered, about 77% of macrofungal species will expand their range, and 57% of areas will see increased species richness. However, when tree distribution changes are also considered, only 50% of species will expand their range, and 49% of areas will experience increased richness. This suggests that tree species play a significant role in shaping macrofungal diversity. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for predicting ecosystem changes and managing biodiversity.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    AimClimate change is affecting biodiversity at an accelerating rate. Despite the importance of fungi in ecosystems in general, and in the global carbon and nitrogen cycle in particular, there is little research on the response of fungi to climate change compared with plants and animals. Earlier studies show that climatic factors and tree species are key determinants of macrofungal diversity and distribution at large spatial scales. However, our knowledge of how climate change will affect macrofungal diversity and distribution in the future remains poorly understood.LocationEurope.MethodsUsing openly available occurrence data of 1845 macrofungal species from eight European countries (i.e. Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Netherlands, Germany, France and Spain), we built ensemble species distribution models to predict macrofungal response to climate change alone and combined climate and tree distribution change under the IPCC special report on 2080 emissions scenarios (SRES A2 and B2).ResultsConsidering climate change alone, we predict that about 77% (74.1%–80.7%) of the modelled species will expand their distribution range, and around 57% (56.1%–58.4%) of the modelled area will have an increase in macrofungal species richness. However, when considering the combined climate and tree species distribution change, only 50% (50%–50.9%) of the species are predicted to expand their distribution range and 49% (47.4%–51.1%) of the modelled area will experience an increase in macrofungal species richness.Main ConclusionsOverall, our models projected that large areas would exhibit increased macrofungal species richness under future climate change. However, tree species distribution might play a restrictive role in the future distributional shifts of macrofungi. In addition, macrofungal responses appear heterogeneous, varying among species and regions. Our findings highlight the importance of including tree species in the projection of climate change impacts on the macrofungal diversity and distribution on a continental scale.
