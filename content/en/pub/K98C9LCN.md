    <h1>About</h1>
    De Groeve et al. studied how European roe deer use different habitats at different times of the day and year to meet their needs. They tracked 154 deer using GPS and analyzed their movements between open areas rich in food and closed areas that offer refuge. The study found that deer commonly switch between these habitats daily and seasonally, adapting to changes in vegetation and their life stages. This behavior supports the idea that animals use complementary habitats to access various resources, helping them survive in landscapes altered by humans. Understanding these patterns can help in wildlife conservation and managing human impacts on animal habitats.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Context The Complementary Habitat Hypothesis  
posits that animals access resources for diferent  
needs by moving between complementary habitats  
that can be seen as ‘resource composites’. These  
movements can occur over a range of temporal scales,  
from diurnal to seasonal, in response to multiple  
drivers such as access to food, weather constraints,  
risk avoidance and human disturbance. Within this  
framework, we hypothesised that large herbivores  
cope with human-altered landscapes through the  
alternate use of complementary habitats at both daily  
and seasonal scales. 
Objectives We tested the Complementary Habitat  
Hypothesis in European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) by classifying 3900 habitat-annotated movement  
trajectories of 154 GPS-monitored individuals across  
contrasting landscapes. 
Methods We considered day-night alternation  
between open food-rich and closed refuge habitats  
as a measure of complementary habitat use. We frst  
identifed day–night alternation using the Individual  
Movement - Sequence Analysis Method, then we  
modelled the proportion of day–night alternation  
over the year in relation to population and individual  
characteristics. 
Results We found that day-night alternation is a  
widespread behaviour in roe deer, even across markedly diferent landscapes. Day–night alternation followed seasonal trends in all populations, partly linked  
to vegetation phenology. Within populations, seasonal  
patterns of open/closed habitat alternation difered  
between male and female adults, but not in juveniles. 
Conclusion Our results support the Complementary Habitat Hypothesis by showing that roe deer  
adjust their access to the varied resources available  
in complex landscapes by including diferent habitats  
within their home range, and sequentially alternating  
between them in response to seasonal changes and  
individual life history.
