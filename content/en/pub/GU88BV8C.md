    <h1>About</h1>
    Bugge and Løtveit conducted a study to understand how student teachers view multicultural society over time. They collected data in 2014 and 2017 from a Norwegian teacher education institution. The study found that student teachers increasingly saw culture as dynamic rather than stable. Most believed that cultural upbringing significantly influences a person's life but not completely. Additionally, nearly all participants viewed intercultural conversations about religion, values, and morals positively. These findings suggest that teacher education programs may be effective in promoting multicultural awareness, which is important for fostering inclusive and understanding classroom environments. This research could help improve teacher training and educational practices.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In this article, we present and discuss the findings from a quantitative study on student teachers’ views on the 
multicultural society. The study is longitudinal, with data collected in 2014 and 2017 at a Norwegian teacher 
education institution. The research questions that are considered involve the degree to which student teachers view culture as either stable or dynamic, whether they consider cultural upbringing to affect a person 
throughout his/her life and how they assess intercultural conversations about religion, values and morals. 
We explore these questions in relation to efforts and calls made by a number of scholars and practitioners to 
develop multicultural awareness in teacher education. The findings indicate that student teachers changed 
their view on culture regarding the dimension stable-dynamic during three years of teacher education. A 
higher proportion regarded culture as largely dynamic in 2017 than in 2014. Possible influences from teacher education are discussed. We also find that the vast majority of student teachers believe that individuals’ 
cultural upbringing influences their adult life significantly but not entirely. Nearly all the respondents considered 
intercultural conversations about religion, values and morals positive. We regard these findings as promising 
and believe that they could have positive implications for teacher education and educational research.
