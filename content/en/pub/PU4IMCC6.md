    <h1>About</h1>
    Nystad et al. studied how toddlers react to the transition from home to childcare by measuring their cortisol levels, a hormone linked to stress. They found that toddlers generally had higher cortisol levels in the afternoon, especially during the phase when they were separated from their parents. These levels tended to decrease by evening, suggesting that children felt more relaxed at home. Younger toddlers (under 14 months) showed higher stress levels both in the evening and after 4-6 weeks in childcare, indicating they might need more time to adjust. Understanding these stress patterns can help improve the transition process for toddlers, making it less stressful for them and their families.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In toddlers, the transition from home to childcare might elicit high 
levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Measuring cortisol may give 
an indicator for children’s experience and hence, may help 
improve this transition. We applied linear mixed model analyses 
to investigate the cortisol levels of 119 toddlers during their 
transition to childcare across time of day (morning, afternoon, 
and evening) and phase (accompanied by parents, separated 
from parents, and after four to six weeks in childcare). The 
influence of age, gender, number of siblings, and childcare group 
size was analyzed. Time of day and phase influenced cortisol 
levels significantly. On average, children had elevated cortisol 
levels in the afternoon throughout transition, with the peak 
coming in the separation phase. Cortisol levels declined 
significantly toward the evening. Children younger than 14 
months showed higher evening levels and higher afternoon 
levels after 4–6 weeks in childcare. The findings suggest that the 
onset of childcare – particularly separation from parents – may be 
demanding for toddlers. Low evening levels indicate relief of 
tension at home. Higher levels of afternoon cortisol of under 14- 
months-old children at the follow-up measurement may indicate 
that younger children need more time to settle in at childcare.
