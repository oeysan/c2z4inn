    <h1>About</h1>
    Börjesson et al. conducted a study to explore how two types of leadership—developmental (similar to transformational leadership) and instrumental—affect performance and job satisfaction among Swedish soldiers. They collected data over three time periods during basic military training. They found that both leadership styles are closely related, but each influences different outcomes: developmental leadership boosts job satisfaction, while instrumental leadership improves performance. Additionally, they identified three consistent leadership profiles over time. The study suggests that leader education should emphasize both interpersonal skills and practical, task-oriented skills. This research is important because it highlights the need for balanced leadership training to enhance both employee satisfaction and performance.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    PurposeThe aim of this study was twofold, first to examine the relationship between developmental leadership (a Scandinavian culture adapted version of transformational leadership) and instrumental leadership, as well as the relationship between these leadership variables and indices of performance and job satisfaction. Second, to identify individual patterns regarding developmental and instrumental leadership.Design/methodology/approachUsing a longitudinal design, questionnaire data were collected three times among Swedish conscripts and voluntarily employed soldiers during their basic military training (n = 667 at T1, n = 503 at T2 and n = 554 at T3).FindingsThe main findings were: (1) high observed correlations between the developmental and instrumental leadership scales on all measurement occasions; (2) a low to moderate amount of explained variance explained by these leadership scales in regression analyses with performance and job satisfaction as dependent variables, where developmental leadership was strongly associated with ratings of job satisfaction and instrumental leadership accounted for a higher proportion of the variance on ratings of performance and (3) the identification of three distinct profiles of response patterns on the leadership scales, which were fairly similar across time and indicate a temporal consistency of leadership styles.Research limitations/implicationsMethodological strengths include the longitudinal study design, the comparatively large sample size, the use of well-established measurement scales and the person-centered approach allowing for the identification of response patterns. Study weaknesses include too few background variables and the use of self-report ratings only. From a work and organizational perspective, the sample with low-level conscripts and soldiers could also be regarded as unusual.Practical implicationsEducation of leaders should focus on the importance of both interpersonal and instrumental aspects. There is also a need for development of leadership training fostering leaders’ instrumental leadership skills.Originality/valueThe study responds to the call from leadership researchers to further research on instrumental leadership and its relationship to the FRLT across diverse organizational contexts. Longitudinal comparisons of developmental (transformational) and instrumental leadership resulted in more trustworthy results as both a variable-oriented and a person-oriented approach was used.
