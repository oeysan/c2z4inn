    <h1>About</h1>
    Dahlberg et al. conducted a study in Sweden to understand the long-term outcomes for young people aged 13-25 with substance use problems (SUP) after outpatient treatment. They followed 451 participants, 29% of whom were girls, for three years. The study found that boys were more likely to continue having substance use problems compared to girls, with 49% of boys and 35% of girls still struggling after three years. Risk factors varied by gender; for boys, drug use frequency and age were significant predictors, while for girls, factors like foster care placement, depression, and early drug use were more predictive. Girls had more psychosocial issues at the start but showed better outcomes over time. The study suggests that treatment approaches should be tailored to address these gender-specific differences.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This study presents the results of a longitudinal research project focusing on long-term outcomes among young people after initiation of outpatient treatment for substance use problems (SUP) in Sweden. Young people are defined with the age group 13â€“25 years. A clinical sample of 451 young people (29% girls, median age 17 years) completed a structured interview at baseline and was followed using official records one, two, and 3 years after initiation of treatment. Gender-specific patterns at intake were described and bivariate associations and logistic regressions were calculated to analyse the links between risk factors at treatment start and indications of substance use problems 3 years later. Significantly more boys than girls displayed indications of continued SUP at 3-year follow-up. More specifically, 49% of the boys vs. 35% of the girls were identified through records as still having problems with substance use. Predictive risk factors also displayed gender-specific patterns. Primary drug use frequency and age at intake predicted indications of SUP among boys but not among girls. Placement in foster care/residential homes, depression, and early drug debut had significant predictive value regarding indications of SUP among females but not among males. Girls also displayed a greater psychosocial burden at treatment start, but a more favorable treatment outcome at follow-up. Youths with a heavy risk load at treatment start (i.e., over six risk factors) did not display a greater risk of SUP at 3-year follow-up, although our results suggest that this subgroup has indications of continued problems with mental health. Consequently, future studies should further explore gender-specific treatment pathways for young people with substance use problems. Since women and girls seem to have different risk factors, co-occurring psychiatric problems and more experiences of trauma compared to men, they might need multidimensional and more comprehensive treatment interventions that run over a longer period of time.
