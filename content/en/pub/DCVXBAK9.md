    <h1>About</h1>
    Adiningrat et al. conducted a study to map old-growth forests in Central Europe using advanced remote sensing techniques. Old-growth forests are crucial for biodiversity and fighting climate change, but they are threatened by logging and environmental issues. The authors combined data from Sentinel-2A satellites, which capture images in different light wavelengths, with 3D structural data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) to get a detailed view of these forests. By using this combined data and a machine learning method called the random forest algorithm, they achieved high accuracy in identifying old-growth forests. This approach can help forest managers and conservationists better monitor and protect these important areas, ensuring their preservation over large regions.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Old-growth forests are essential to preserve biodiversity and play an important role in sequestering carbon and mitigating climate change. However, their existence across Europe is vulnerable due to the scarcity of their distribution, logging, and environmental threats. Therefore, providing the current status of old-growth forests across Europe is essential to aiding informed conservation efforts and sustainable forest management. Remote sensing techniques have proven effective for mapping and monitoring forests over large areas. However, relying solely on remote sensing spectral or structural information cannot capture comprehensive horizontal and vertical structure complexity profiles associated with old-growth forest characteristics. To overcome this issue, we combined spectral information from Sentinel-2A multispectral imagery with 3D structural information from high-density point clouds of airborne laser scanning (ALS) imagery to map old-growth forests over an extended area. Four features from the ALS data and fifteen from Sentinel-2A comprising raw band (spectral reflectance), vegetation indices (VIs), and texture were selected to create three datasets used in the classification process using the random forest algorithm. The results demonstrated that combining ALS and Sentinel-2A features improved the classification performance and yielded the highest accuracy for old-growth class, with an F1-score of 92% and producer’s and user’s accuracies of 93% and 90%, respectively. The findings suggest that features from ALS and Sentinel-2A data sensitive to forest structure are essential for identifying old-growth forests. Integrating open-access satellite imageries, such as Sentinel-2A and ALS data, can benefit forest managers, stakeholders, and conservationists in monitoring old-growth forest preservation across a broader spatial extent.
