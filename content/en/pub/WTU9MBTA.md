    <h1>About</h1>
    Skyrud and Trollvik conducted a study to understand the experiences and challenges faced by individuals with morbid obesity during a long-term lifestyle intervention. They interviewed seven participants who had been part of a group-based program for over a year. The study found that while morbidly obese individuals often fear failure due to past unsuccessful weight loss attempts, they can achieve and maintain effective lifestyle changes with proper guidance, education, and support from health professionals. Additionally, being part of a supportive group with others facing similar challenges helps them stay motivated and reality-oriented. This research highlights the importance of comprehensive support systems in helping morbidly obese individuals succeed in their weight loss journeys.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The experiences and challenges faced by morbid obese subjects when participating in lifestyle intervention  
The aim of this study was to examine the experiences and challenges of the morbidly obese when participating in a long-term lifestyle intervention. The subjects, whom qualified as morbidly obese, participated for over a year in a group-based lifestyle intervention with ongoing treatments. A qualitative design was chosen to collect descriptive information throughout semi-structured interviews. There was a total of seven informants (male and female). Weight loss in the morbidly obese is typically achieved through conservative management and lifestyle intervention, with bariatric surgery reserved as a last option. Patients diagnosed with morbid obesity are often concerned about failing yet again after multiple attempts of weight loss. However, when guidance, education, and support from health professionals is provided in addition to active participation within a supportive group with other morbidly obese people, patients become reality-oriented and able to both initiate and sustain an effective lifestyle change.
