    <h1>About</h1>
    Alinejad et al. conducted a review on the health risks associated with opium adulterated with lead in Iran. They found that lead contamination in opium is a significant public health issue, leading to increased cases of lead poisoning among users. Lead poisoning can cause symptoms that resemble other diseases, often resulting in misdiagnosis and unnecessary medical procedures. The authors emphasize the importance of screening for lead toxicity in individuals who abuse drugs, especially when they exhibit vague symptoms like abdominal pain, constipation, and anemia. By prioritizing blood tests to check lead levels, healthcare providers can better diagnose and treat affected individuals, potentially reducing the harmful impact of lead exposure from adulterated opium.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Adulteration of drugs with poisonous substances during production or consumption 
has caused numerous health problems. Among contaminants that have the potential of 
producing poisonous effects are the heavy metals lead, arsenic and thallium that make up an 
important group of toxic substances. The emergence of these new health problems related to 
opioid abuse has precipitated this Mini 
Review on the status of the most hazardous and 
common opioid adulterants. In fact, adulterated opium is a major public health problem and 
can threaten the health of users. In this study, we searched for information on opium, 
opiates, lead poisoning, toxicity, intoxication, Iran and heavy metals in the TUMS DigitalLibrary, PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE and Google Scholar bibliographical databases. This 
Mini 
Review primarily included articles on lead poisoning, signs and symptoms, and 
management in opioid 
-dependent individuals. Exclusion criteria were articles dealing with 
animal studies, specific p 
aediatric studies, adulterants other than heavy metals and substances 
other than opioids. Adulterated opium is one of the new sources of exposure to lead and has 
precipitated an increase in lead 
-poisoned cases owing to the widespread use of opium. The 
toxicology of lead and general guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of lead poisoning is 
briefly reviewed. The symptoms of lead toxicity mimic several diseases often leading to 
unnecessary diagnostic methods, misdiagnoses and even surgery. Finally, owing to the fact 
that lead toxicity shows non 
-specific signs and symptoms, screening for this disease, by 
taking blood samples and assessing blood lead levels in high 
-risk people, should be given an 
utmost priority. It is recommended that screening tests are adopted and applied for any drug 
abusing patient with non 
-specific subacute signs and symptoms like abdominal pain, 
constipation and an 
aemia.
