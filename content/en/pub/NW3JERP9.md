    <h1>About</h1>
    Milford et al. conducted a study on how organic fruits and vegetables are marketed in Norway. They found that large supermarket chains require farmers to supply large quantities of uniform products, which is challenging for smaller farmers. These smaller farmers, who are often located near urban areas, prefer selling through local channels like farmers' markets and community-supported agriculture (CSA). This allows them to use organic farming methods more easily and focus on quality and sustainability rather than income. Larger farmers, typically in rural areas, tend to supply mainstream supermarkets. Despite these differences, the study found no evidence that organic farming in Norway is becoming more conventional. This research highlights the diverse approaches farmers take to market their organic produce and the impact of sales channels on farming practices.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Most food in developed countries, including organic fruits and vegetables, is sold through supply chains run by large wholesalers and supermarket chains. A certain share is sold through local marketing channels such as speciality stores, food box schemes, farmers' markets, and community-supported agriculture (CSA). This study uses qualitative interviews and a quantitative survey to expose the differences between mainstream and local marketing of organic fruits and vegetables in Norway, why and to what extent farmers selling through these two sales channels are different. We find that the supermarket chains' requirements to provide large quantities of uniform product are burdensome for smaller farmers to match. Farmers supplying the mainstream supermarkets tend to be larger and more rurally located. Farmers selling through local marketing are likely to be smaller, closer to urban areas and more diversified in their production. For local marketing farmers, it is more feasible to produce according to organic principles, using local resources and crop rotation. Survey results also show that local marketing farmers are less motivated to produce fruits and vegetables by income and more motivated to produce organically to achieve better quality and sustainability. At the same time, there are also many similarities between the two groups, and we do not find evidence of a general “conventionalisation” of organic agriculture in Norway.
