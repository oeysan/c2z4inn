    <h1>About</h1>
    Bongaardt et al. provide a practical guide to qualitative research in their book "Qualitative Research in Practice." They explain how qualitative research focuses on understanding social phenomena through participants' perspectives, rather than relying on numerical data. This approach is valuable for studying experiences and emotions that can't be easily measured. The book includes examples and analyses from various fields like social work, psychology, education, and healthcare, making it a useful resource for students and professionals. It aims to help readers design, conduct, and evaluate qualitative studies, offering hands-on skills that can be applied in real-world settings. This resource is designed to bridge the gap between learning about qualitative research and effectively using it in practice.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    "A practical introduction to qualitative research across fields and disciplines Qualitative Research in Practice offers a hands-on introduction to qualitative research design, methods, data, and analysis. Designed as a companion text for any course involving qualitative research, this book explores the different types of qualitative studies with relevant examples and analysis by the researchers themselves. The workbook format makes it easy to use in the classroom or the field, and the depth of information makes it a valuable resource for students of social work, psychology, counseling, management, education, health care, or any field in which qualitative research is conducted. While quantitative research is primarily concerned with numerical data, qualitative research methods are more flexible, responsive, and open to contextual information. To a qualitative researcher, a situation is defined by the participants' perspectives, making it the primary method of inquiry for understanding social phenomena through the lens of experience. This book introduces the essentials of qualitative research, bolstered by expert analysis and discussion that provides deeper insight than a traditional textbook format would allow. Understand the fundamental nature of qualitative research Learn how to accurately assess and evaluate qualitative research Explore qualitative research's many forms and applications Gain insight on qualitative research in a variety of fields and disciplines How does one codify an experience? Is it possible to measure emotion in units? Qualitative research fills the void where numbers cannot reach. It is the best tool we have for studying the unquantifiable aspects of the human experience, and it is an essential tool in a wide variety of fields. Qualitative Research in Practice provides translatable skills in a practical format to quicken your transition from "learning" to "using."--Publisher.
