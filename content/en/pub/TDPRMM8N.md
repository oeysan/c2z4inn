    <h1>About</h1>
    Moyo et al. conducted a study to understand consumer preferences for boiled sweetpotato varieties in Ghana and Uganda using a method called crowdsourced citizen science. They involved 1,433 participants who tasted sweetpotatoes either at home or in a controlled setting. The study aimed to see if home tasting (where participants prepare the food themselves) would yield similar results to centralized tasting (where preparation is controlled). They found that both methods produced similar rankings for overall acceptability, which was mainly influenced by taste. This means that the tricot approach, where farmers act as "citizen scientists," can effectively identify preferred sweetpotato varieties. This method helps ensure that new sweetpotato varieties meet the tastes and preferences of local consumers.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Crowdsourced citizen science is an emerging approach in plant sciences. The 
triadic comparison of technologies (tricot) approach has been successfully utilized 
by demand-led breeding programmes to identify varieties for dissemination suited to 
specific geographic and climatic regions. An important feature of this approach is the 
independent way in which farmers individually evaluate the varieties on their own farms 
as “citizen scientists.” In this study, we adapted this approach to evaluate consumer 
preferences to boiled sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam] roots of 21 advanced 
breeding materials and varieties in Ghana and 6 released varieties in Uganda. We 
were specifically interested in evaluating if a more independent style of evaluation 
(home tasting) would produce results comparable to an approach that involves control 
over preparation (centralized tasting). We compiled data from 1,433 participants who 
individually contributed to a home tasting (de-centralized) and a centralized tasting trial in 
Ghana and Uganda, evaluating overall acceptability, and indicating the reasons for their 
preferences. Geographic factors showed important contribution to define consumers’ 
preference to boiled sweetpotato genotypes. Home and centralized tasting approaches 
gave similar rankings for overall acceptability, which was strongly correlated to taste. 
In both Ghana and Uganda, it was possible to robustly identify superior sweetpotato 
genotypes from consumers’ perspectives. Our results indicate that the tricot approach 
can be successfully applied to consumer preference studies
