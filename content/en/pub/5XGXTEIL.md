    <h1>About</h1>
    Olsson et al. conducted a study to understand healthcare professionals' views on the quality of palliative care in a combined acute oncology-palliative care unit in Sweden. They surveyed 41 professionals using a detailed questionnaire to compare the actual care patients received with the importance of that care from the professionals' perspective. The findings showed that areas needing improvement included symptom relief, addressing spiritual and existential needs, providing information, patient participation, continuity of care, care planning, and coordination. The study suggests that integrating a person-centered palliative care model, inspired by hospice philosophy, could enhance care quality. This matters because improving palliative care can significantly impact the comfort and well-being of patients undergoing cancer treatment.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    It is a challenge to ensure high-quality palliative care. The aim was to investigate the perceptions of health care professionals (HCPs) working in a combined acute oncology-palliative care unit regarding the quality of the palliative care received by the patients and how important the care was to the patients. A Swedish total-survey cross-sectional study including 41 HCPs (54% response rate) was conducted with the 52 items Quality from the Patient’s Perspective – Palliative Care instrument, answered in two different ways: as actual care received and subjective importance. The STROBE-checklist was used. The areas for improvements were related to symptom relief, spiritual and existential needs, information, patient participation, continuity of care, care planning, cooperation and coordination of care, as subjective importance scores were higher than corresponding scores for care received ( p ≤ .025). Providing high-quality palliative care alongside curative treatments for cancer patients is known to be challenging and could explain the results in this study. Implementation of a person-centred palliative care model based on the hospice philosophy could be a solution.
