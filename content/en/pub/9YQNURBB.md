    <h1>About</h1>
    Litleskare and Calogiuri conducted a study in Norway to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affected people's visits to nature and outdoor activities. They found that 32% of participants increased their nature visits during the pandemic, while 11% visited nature less often. Longer lockdowns were linked to more frequent nature visits, especially among women, younger people, and those from high-income households. The main reason for increased nature visits was to stay physically active, with many using nature as an alternative to gyms and sports. The study suggests that nature visits helped people stay active and potentially improve mental health during the pandemic, highlighting the importance of promoting access to natural environments for overall well-being.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to increased mental 
health issues and reduced well-being. Researchers also reports increased 
frequency of nature visits during the pandemic, proposing it may mitigate some 
of these negative consequences. Using the case of Norway, a country with ample 
access to nature and relatively low levels of pandemic-related restrictions, this 
study sought to (i) understand how the COVID-19 crisis impacted patterns of 
nature visits and specific nature-based activities, (ii) examine how these patterns 
varied among dierent population groups and levels of restrictions, and (iii) explore 
the motives and facilitators for increased frequency of nature visits. 
Methods: The data were retrieved from a national cross-sectional survey 
conducted in June 2021, which was designed to assess participants (n = 1,005, 
age > 15 years) habits in relation to nature visits and outdoor recreation since the 
beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, and associated factors. 
Results: The results showed that 32 % of participants increased their frequency 
of nature visits during the crisis, while 11 % experienced a decrease. Multivariate 
logistic regression revealed significant positive associations between increased 
frequency of nature visits and longer duration of lockdown restrictions (OR [95% 
CI] = 2.35 [1.28–4.29] and 4.92 [2.77–8.74] for a few weeks and several months 
of lockdown, respectively). Increased frequency of nature visits was also more 
likely among women, younger respondents, and individuals from high-income 
households. A Cochran’s Q test showed that the most common motive for 
increased frequency of nature visits was “To be physically active” (74%). The most 
commonly reported facilitators were the possibility of using natural environments 
as an alternative to gyms and organized sports alongside having more time 
available (58 and 49%, respectively). 
Conclusion: These findings suggest that nature visits provided important 
opportunities for physical activity during the COVID-19 crisis, but also that 
the mental health benefits of nature visits during such times may be undercommunicated. This highlights the importance of access to natural environments 
to promote physical activity and health, but also suggests that campaigns that 
specifically communicate the beneficial eects of nature visits during lockdowns 
or similar stressful situations might help people cope with the situation.
