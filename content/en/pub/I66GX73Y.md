    <h1>About</h1>
    Dellsén explores the difference between expert consensus and unanimity in the context of climate science. They highlight that about 97% of climate scientists agree that human activities contribute to global warming. The study argues that for non-experts, a strong consensus among experts can be more convincing than complete unanimity. This is because a consensus shows that the theory has been thoroughly examined and debated, making it more reliable. The findings suggest that laypeople should trust scientific consensus, journalists should accurately report the level of agreement among scientists, and scientists should effectively communicate their findings to the public. This helps ensure that people make informed decisions based on credible scientific evidence.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Around 97% of climate scientists endorse anthropogenic global warming (AGW), the theory that human activities are partly responsible for recent increases in global average temperatures. Clearly, this widespread endorsement of AGW is a reason for non-experts to believe in AGW. But what is the epistemic significance of the fact that some climate scientists do not endorse AGW? This paper contrasts expert unanimity, in which virtually no expert disagrees with some theory, with expert consensus, in which some non-negligible proportion either rejects or is uncertain about the theory. It is argued that, from a layperson’s point of view, an expert consensus is often stronger evidence for a theory’s truth than unanimity. Several lessons are drawn from this conclusion, e.g. concerning what laypeople should infer from expert pronouncements, how journalists should report on scientific theories, and how working scientists should communicate with the public.
