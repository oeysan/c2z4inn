    <h1>About</h1>
    Ellingsen et al. conducted a study using eye-tracking technology to explore how personality traits, specifically extraversion and introversion, influence attention to facial emotions. They found that extraverts tend to focus more on faces showing positive emotions, especially the mouth area of smiling faces, compared to introverts. This means extraverts spend more time looking at these areas, which could suggest they are more drawn to positive social cues. The study highlights how personality can affect where and how long people look at different parts of a face, which can impact social interactions. Understanding these differences can help in fields like psychology and communication, where recognizing how people perceive emotions is important for improving social connections and interactions.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Emotions and personality traits seem to be important factors affecting social attention. In the present study, we used eye-tracking equipment to investigate the differences between extraverts and introverts in visual attention to positive and negative emotions shown in human faces. We want to describe more detailed types of eye movements in this visual attention, and especially pat-terns of spatial and temporal fixations. Based on previous research we would expect that extraverts would be more attentive to faces showing positive emotions compared to introverts.Participants and procedureEmotions and personality traits seem to be important factors affecting social attention. The current study investigated differences between extraverts’ and introverts’ visual attentional focus on positive and negative emotions expressed in human faces.ResultsCompared to the introverts group, extraverts showed significantly longer average fixation duration (AFD) for whole faces per-ceived to express positive emotions. There were no significant differences between the groups for dwelling time (DT), entry time (ET), and first fixation (FF). However, the extraversion group showed significantly longer DT, FF and AFD attention towards the mouth area compared to the introverts.ConclusionsExtraverts seem to show a selective visual attentional bias towards positive emotions in human faces, particularly towards the mouth area of smiling faces compared to introverts. The study showed that the visual mechanisms behind this selective attention were differences in temporal fixation patterns such as average fixation duration, dwelling time and first fixation time.
