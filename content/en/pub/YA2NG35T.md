    <h1>About</h1>
    Kraak et al. explore how research on psychological contracts (PCs)—the unwritten expectations between employers and employees—can improve workplace relationships. They emphasize the importance of aligning PC research with real-world needs to create sustainable and high-quality work environments. The paper, stemming from a global conference, suggests ways to enhance the impact of PC knowledge across three areas: research, practice and society, and education. By incorporating an "ethics of care" perspective, the authors aim to redefine PCs to promote ethical and sustainable employment practices. This work matters because it seeks to bridge the gap between academic research and practical application, benefiting not just scholars, but also practitioners, policymakers, and students in understanding and improving workplace dynamics.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This paper is the result of the collective work undertaken by a group of Psychological Contract (PC) and Sustainability scholars from around the world, following the 2023 Bi-Annual PC Small Group Conference (Kedge Business School, Bordeaux, France). As part of the conference, scholars engaged in a workshop designed to generate expert guidance on how to aid the PC field to be better aligned with the needs of practice, and thus, impact the creation and maintenance of high-quality and sustainable exchange processes at work. In accordance with accreditation bodies for higher education, research impact is not limited to academic papers alone but also includes practitioners, policymakers, and students in its scope. This paper therefore incorporates elements from an impact measurement tool for higher education in management so as to explore how PC scholars can bolster the beneficial influence of PC knowledge on employment relationships through different stakeholders and means. Accordingly, our proposals for the pursuit of PC impact are organized in three parts: (1) research, (2) practice and society, and (3) students. Further, this paper contributes to the emerging debate on sustainable PCs by developing a construct definition and integrating PCs with an ‘ethics of care’ perspective.
