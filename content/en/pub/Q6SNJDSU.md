    <h1>About</h1>
    Thompson et al. conducted a study to understand how elite strength and conditioning (S&C) coaches perceive and use velocity-based training (VBT). VBT is a method that uses speed to guide training decisions. Fourteen high-performance coaches were interviewed, revealing three main themes: technology, applications, and reflections. Coaches discussed why they chose certain technologies, how they programmed and monitored training, and the benefits and drawbacks of VBT. They found VBT helpful for planning and tracking training, but noted challenges depending on the environment and personal preferences. Overall, VBT is seen as a useful tool for improving training effectiveness and monitoring athlete readiness, though its application can vary widely. This study helps bridge the gap between research and practical use in elite sports settings.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Velocity-based training (VBT) is a contemporary prescriptive, programming, and testing tool commonly utilised in strength and conditioning (S&C). Over recent years, there has been an influx of peer-reviewed literature investigating several different applications (e.g. load-velocity profiling, velocity loss, load manipulation, and reliability of technology) of VBT. The procedures implemented in research, however, do not always reflect the practices within applied environments. The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the perceptions and applications of VBT within elite S&C to enhance contextual understanding and develop appropriate avenues of practitioner-focused research. Fourteen high-performance S&C coaches participated in semi-structured interviews to discuss their experiences of implementing VBT into their practices. Reflexive thematic analysis was adopted, following an inductive and realist approach. Three central organising themes emerged: Technology, applications, and reflections. Within these central themes, higher order themes consisting of drivers for buying technology; programming, testing, monitoring, and feedback; and benefits, drawbacks, and future uses also emerged. Practitioners reported varied drivers and applications of VBT, often being dictated by simplicity, environmental context, and personal preferences. Coaches perceived VBT to be a beneficial tool yet were cognizant of the drawbacks and challenges in certain settings. VBT is a flexible tool that can support and aid several aspects of S&C planning and delivery, with coaches valuing the impact it can have on training environments, objective prescriptions, tracking player readiness, and programme success.
