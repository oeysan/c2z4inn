    <h1>About</h1>
    Sargenius et al. conducted a study to understand how severe obesity affects visual-constructional abilities, using the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT). They compared the performance of 96 morbidly obese individuals with 100 healthy controls. While both groups showed similar accuracy in copying the figure, the obese group performed worse in terms of the quality of their copying process, as measured by the Q-score. This score evaluates the approach and organization used in the task, rather than just accuracy. The findings suggest that severe obesity may impact cognitive processes related to visuospatial construction. Understanding these differences can help in developing better cognitive assessments and interventions for individuals with severe obesity.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The aims of this study were to investigate visual-construction and organizational strategy 
among individuals with severe obesity, as measured by the Rey Complex Figure Test 
(RCFT), and to examine the validity of the Q-score as a measure for the quality of 
performance on the RCFT. Ninety-six non-demented morbidly obese (MO) patients and 
100 healthy controls (HC) completed the RCFT. Their performance was calculated by 
applying the standard scoring criteria. The quality of the copying process was evaluated 
per the directions of the Q-score scoring system. Results revealed that the MO did not 
perform significantly lower than the HC on Copy accuracy (mean difference −0.302, 
CI −1.374 to 0.769, p = 0.579). In contrast, the groups did statistically differ from 
each other, with MO performing poorer than the HC on the Q-score (mean −1.784, 
CI −3.237 to −0.331, p = 0.016) and the Unit points (mean −1.409, CI −2.291 to 
−0.528, p = 0.002), but not on the Order points score (mean −0.351, CI −0.994 to 
0.293, p = 0.284). Differences on the Unit score and the Q-score were slightly reduced 
when adjusting for gender, age, and education. This study presents evidence supporting 
the presence of inefficiency in visuospatial constructional ability among MO patients. We 
believe we have found an indication that the Q-score captures a wider range of cognitive 
processes that are not described by traditional scoring methods. Rather than considering 
accuracy and placement of the different elements only, the Q-score focuses more on how 
the subject has approached the task.
