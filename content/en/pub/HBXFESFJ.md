    <h1>About</h1>
    Degirmenci et al. conducted a study on energy drink consumption among adolescents in Norway. They surveyed 31,091 students aged 12-19 and found that over half of them consumed energy drinks, with 3.5% being high consumers (drinking energy drinks four or more times a week). Boys consumed twice as much as girls, and older students (ages 15-19) and those living in rural areas were more likely to be high consumers. Factors like lower socioeconomic status, less physical activity, and more screen time were linked to higher consumption. This study highlights the widespread use of energy drinks among young people and suggests that lifestyle and demographic factors play a significant role in consumption patterns. Understanding these factors can help in developing strategies to address potential health risks associated with high energy drink intake.

    Background 
Energy drink (ED) consumption is increasing all over the world. We sought to describe the consumption of EDs among adolescents in Norway, and to explore the determinants of daily and high consumption. 
 
Methods 
Population-based cross-sectional data were collected from a sample of 31,091 secondary school students in grade 8–13 aged 12–19 years. School grade, residency, socioeconomic status (SES), physical activity and leisure screen time were included in multiple regression analyses, in order to investigate their associations with daily and high (≥four times weekly) ED consumption. 
 
Results 
52.3% of the respondents were ED consumers and 3.5% were high consumers. Boys consumed twice as much ED as girls (boys: 36.3 ml/day, girls: 18.5 ml/day, geometric means), and the proportion of male high consumers was 3.7-times higher than that of females. The adjusted odd ratio (OR) of upper secondary school (grades 11–13, ages 15–19) students being high ED consumers were higher than for lower secondary school (grades 8–10, ages 12–15) students (OR 1.1(confidence interval (CI):1.0–1.3)), as well as higher for rural than urban residents (OR 1.3 (CI: 1.1–1.5)). Gradients for the increased ORs of being a high ED consumer were found for decreased SES, decreased frequency of physical activity and increased daily leisure screen time. 
 
Conclusions 
More than half of the respondents reported that they were ED consumers. Daily and high consumption were independently associated with male gender, physical inactivity, high leisure screen time, low socioeconomic status and rural residency.
