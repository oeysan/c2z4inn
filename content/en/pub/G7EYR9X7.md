    <h1>About</h1>
    Holmene examines how film companies in Norway use social media to promote their movies. By analyzing applications for promotional grants from the Norwegian Film Institute in 2015, Holmene found that large film distributors view social media as a place to buy targeted attention using data from platforms like Facebook and YouTube. In contrast, smaller independent companies often see social media as a free way to gain visibility. This difference in strategy highlights how larger companies use their resources and knowledge to gain an advantage, creating a power imbalance between them and smaller players. Understanding these strategies is important because it shows how social media can influence the success of films and the dynamics within the film industry.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In this article, I explore how conglomerates and the independent film companies in Norway conceptualize their social media strategies before the release of their films in movie theatres. I analyse applications made to the Norwegian Film Institute’s (NFI) support programme for promotional grants in 2015. The ability of individual companies to interpret and go beyond a framing of social media as semi-public platforms – where companies can gain visibility free of charge – is one indication of how strategic knowledge differs. Major distributors tend to perceive social media as a place to buy attention from a targeted audience. Thus, they are taking advantage of traffic data offered by surveillance technologies embedded in social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. This, I argue, is a distinct feature of strategic resources linked to power, networks and knowledge about audiences, which intensify power differentials between large, established corporations and small-scale independent players.
