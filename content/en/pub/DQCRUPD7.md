    <h1>About</h1>
    Barmoen et al. conducted a study in Norway to explore public trust in large carnivore science, which is crucial for effective wildlife management. They surveyed 2,110 people across various regions to understand how trust varies among different groups. The study found that elderly men, individuals with lower education levels, those who have lost livestock to carnivores, big game hunters, and people who fear large carnivores tend to have lower trust in scientific information about these animals. This is important because trust in science influences how policies are accepted and implemented. Understanding these trust patterns can help improve communication strategies and manage conflicts related to large carnivores, ensuring better coexistence between humans and wildlife.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Large carnivores are controversial species, and associated conficts between stakeholders with opposing views on large  
carnivores are observed across the globe. Social trust, the public’s willingness to rely on those responsible for developing  
policies, has gained much attention regarding the acceptance of large carnivores and large carnivore management. However,  
trust in large carnivore science has not received as much consideration. In Norway, administrative management authorities  
are responsible to execute the political framework decided by the Norwegian Parliament while basing their decisions on  
recommendations from large carnivore science. As large carnivore science is the main knowledge provider for monitoring  
and measures implemented in management decisions to achieve viable carnivore populations, trust in science is crucial. Yet,  
scientifc information is often challenged. As attitude studies show a tendency for the wider general public to be more positive towards large carnivores than people most adversely afected, we wanted to examine whether the trust in large carnivore  
science follows the same pattern. We used a geographically stratifed sample of 2110 respondents, fve respondents from each  
municipality in Norway, to model how trust varies across the sample. Our results indicate that elderly men, people with lower  
education, those who have experienced loss of livestock to carnivores associate with lower trust in large carnivore science.  
Lower trust was also found among big game hunters and people who fear large carnivores. This knowledge could help to  
guide targeted science communication and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of cognitions important for  
management of conficts involving large carnivores.
