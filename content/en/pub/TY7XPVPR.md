    <h1>About</h1>
    Evenstad conducted a study on the impact of increasing work efficiency, known as ephemeralization, on ICT workers' mental health. They found that while efficiency can improve living standards, it also leads to stress and burnout. The rapid pace of work and communication in organizations causes information overload and intensifies work pressure. ICT workers, who enable this acceleration, experience constant time pressure, frequent changes, and a fast technological pace, leading to stress, burnout, and conflicts between work and family life. Participants reported feeling alienated and dehumanized. The study also noted cultural differences between French and Norwegian workers, highlighting how time perception varies across cultures. This research emphasizes the need to address the mental health challenges faced by ICT workers due to accelerated work environments.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Ephemeralization, that is, an accelerating increase in the efficiency of achieving the same or more output while requiring less input, may give us ever-increasing standards of living. However, it may also result in mental health problems such as stress and burnout. The acceleration discourses and dispositifs such as ICT systems have resulted in automatized and accelerated work processes making work more intensified and stressful. The pace of internal and external communication in organizations has also increased, resulting in information overload. The enablers of this acceleration, namely the ICT workers, experience also acceleration. The subjective experience of acceleration as a source of stress for ICT workers has been overlooked in the burnout research. Using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) and mobilizing concepts from critical theory, cybernetics, and discourse theory, this paper presents a systemic perspective on acceleration and ICT worker burnout. The participants have experienced acceleration as a constant time pressure, work intensification, hyperconnectivity, frequent organizational changes, short-termism, and rapid pace of technological change. Consequences were stress, burnout, and work-family conflicts. They felt alienated and dehumanized at work. There were some significant differences between French and Norwegian groups’ experiences, revealing the intimate link between temporality and culture.
