    <h1>About</h1>
    Darul et al. examined the coat patterns of Eurasian lynx to understand if their fur variations are due to environmental adaptation or historical factors. They analyzed 672 photos of lynx across Eurasia, categorizing their coats into five types: large spotted, unspotted, rosettes, small spots, and pseudo-rosettes. They found that most lynx had either large spots (41.5%) or were unspotted (36.2%). The study revealed that the distribution of these coat patterns is more influenced by historical factors, specifically the locations of glacial refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum, rather than current environmental conditions. This suggests that past climate changes have played a significant role in shaping the fur patterns of Eurasian lynx, rather than their immediate surroundings.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    We studied the relationship between the variability and contemporary distribution of pelage phenotypes in one of most widely  
distributed felid species and an array of environmental and demographic conditions. We collected 672 photographic georeferenced records of the Eurasian lynx throughout Eurasia. We assigned each lynx coat to one of fve phenotypes. Then we  
ftted the coat patterns to diferent environmental and anthropogenic variables, as well as the efective geographic distances  
from inferred glacial refugia. A majority of lynx were either of the large spotted (41.5%) or unspotted (uniform, 36.2%)  
phenotype. The remaining patterns (rosettes, small spots and pseudo-rosettes) were represented in 11.0%, 7.4%, and 3.9% of  
samples, respectively. Although various environmental variables greatly afected lynx distribution and habitat suitability, it  
was the efect of least-cost distances from locations of the inferred refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum that explained  
the distribution of lynx coat patterns the best. Whereas the occurrence of lynx phenotypes with large spots was explained by  
the proximity to refugia located in the Caucasus/Middle East, the uniform phenotype was associated with refugia in the Far  
East and Central Asia. Despite the widely accepted hypothesis of adaptive functionality of coat patterns in mammals and  
exceptionally high phenotypic polymorphism in Eurasian lynx, we did not fnd well-defned signs of habitat matching in the  
coat pattern of this species. Instead, we showed how the global patterns of morphological variability in this large mammal  
and its environmental adaptations may have been shaped by past climatic change.
