    <h1>About</h1>
    Meziani et al. conducted a study comparing how capoeira masters in Brazil and boxing coaches in France work with people with disabilities. They found that both groups use an "ecological" approach, which means they focus on the overall well-being and vulnerability of individuals. This approach is based on an "ethics of care," emphasizing support and inclusion. Additionally, these sports professionals are adapting their methods to gain income and social status, which is different from traditional care practices. By highlighting the educational and welfare benefits of their sports, they aim to play a more significant role in society and address disability-related needs. This research shows how sports can be a powerful tool for social inclusion and support for people with disabilities.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Using a sociological perspective, the article shows that masters of capoeira in Brazil and boxing coaches in France have adopted an ‘ecological’ approach to society, particularly when they are working with people with disabilities. The comparative research presented in this paper is based on ethnographic data. The authors demonstrate that the ecological approach developed in these two activities is based on an ‘ethics of care’ perspective which focuses on human vulnerability. At the same time, social actors are adapting to a context which has the potential to provide income and new status. This situation differs from what is traditionally observed in care studies. Boxing coaches and masters of capoeira are developing a ‘strategic-functionalist’ approach whereby they demonstrate the educational and welfare functions of their respective practices. By doing so, they seek to occupy a more important place in the social arena by meeting disability-related expectations and new challenges linked to inclusion.
