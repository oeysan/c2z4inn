    <h1>About</h1>
    Egan and Rawoens conducted a study comparing how the concept of "overness" is expressed in motion-related sentences in English and French. "Overness" refers to a spatial relationship where one object is above another. They analyzed translations of Norwegian texts to see how this concept is coded in both languages. Using data from the Oslo Multilingual Corpus, they examined how motion events are described, focusing on aspects like manner, path, site, and ground. They found that English typically follows a pattern known as satellite-framed language, where the manner of motion is emphasized. French, however, showed a more mixed approach, not fitting neatly into the path-framed language category. This study highlights significant differences in how these languages describe motion, which can affect translation and language learning.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In this paper we discuss ways in which the concept that, for want of a better word, we may describe as ‘overness’ is coded in motion predications in English and French. The concept of ‘overness’ is a relational one, the basic spatial sense of which involves some sort of (elongated) superiority of a Figure (a Trajector in the terminology employed by cognitive linguists) vis-à-vis a Ground. This study compares codings in English and French of this concept as it is instantiated in translations of the same original Norwegian texts. The data for the study are taken from the Oslo Multilingual Corpus. Tokens coding motion events are analysed in detail in terms of the coding of Manner, Path, Site and Ground. The results of the study point to substantial differences between English and French in their codings of motion events, with English conforming by and large to the satellite-framed language type. The results for French are much less clear, with the picture resembling more a sort of typological hybrid than a rigid path-framed type.
