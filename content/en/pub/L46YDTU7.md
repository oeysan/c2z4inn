    <h1>About</h1>
    Van Trijp et al. conducted a study to understand how shyness in toddlers affects their well-being during their first year in Norwegian early childhood education and care (ECEC) centers. They followed 567 children, collecting data from their parents at two points: before starting ECEC and after one year. The study found that toddlers who were shy when they started ECEC tended to have lower well-being by the end of their first year. This suggests that shy children may need extra support to thrive in early education settings. The findings emphasize the importance of recognizing and addressing shyness in young children to ensure their emotional and social well-being in ECEC environments.

ABSTRACT 
Using a multilevel random-coefficient approach, we examined the longitudinal association between toddlers’ early shyness and their well-being during their first year in Norwegian early childhood education and care (ECEC) centres. We used data from two measurement points (preintervention and postintervention) from a larger cluster randomized controlled trial study, Thrive by 3. We followed 567 children (answered by 415 mothers and 152 fathers) who were younger than 19 months and had just started in ECEC at preintervention. Our findings indicate that toddlers’ early shyness during their starting period in ECEC is associated with their well-being by the end of their first year in ECEC. Our findings highlight the importance of paying extra attention to shy toddlers, as they seem to show less well-being during their early period in ECEC.
