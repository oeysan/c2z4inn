    <h1>About</h1>
    Jacobsen et al. explored how architectural design evolves during competitions. They studied how architects' designs change and develop through visual representations, like drawings and models, which are shared among clients, architects, and juries. These visual tools help communicate ideas but also introduce new challenges and discussions. By observing a real competition, they found that design is not a straightforward process but a dynamic one where roles and ideas constantly shift. This research highlights the importance of visual tools in shaping and transforming architectural projects, showing that design is a collaborative and ongoing process. Understanding this can help improve how architectural competitions are organized and how designs are developed and judged.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Organisational research positions design as complex and open-ended. We contribute to research on design and the organisation of competition by conceptualising design as redesign and as a collective ‘thing’ consisting of an interconnected and dynamically evolving set of new design issues and matters of concern that blur actors’ professional roles. Our approach builds on actor-network theory using an ethnographic study to follow architects’ design work in a commercial case of a dialogue-based architectural competition. Building scales and design concepts were translated and inscribed into different forms of design visualisations and circulated amongst the client, the architect office, and the workshop during the encounter between the team of architects and the jury. As circulating references, design visualisations retain and transform the design and give rise to new contradictory design issues during the actors’ verbal dialogue.
