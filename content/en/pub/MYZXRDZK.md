    <h1>About</h1>
    Adiningrat et al. conducted a study to improve the identification of old-growth forests, which are crucial for biodiversity. They focused on using LiDAR, a technology that uses laser light to map forest structures. Instead of relying on traditional metrics like tree height and density, they optimized a set of advanced LiDAR metrics that better capture the complexity of forest canopies. By analyzing these metrics, they found that structural metrics, which consider canopy layers and openness, are more effective in distinguishing old-growth forests from younger ones. Their approach achieved a 78% accuracy rate in identifying old-growth forests. This method can help forest managers efficiently monitor and protect these vital ecosystems, ensuring their preservation for future generations.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Old-growth forests are essential for maintaining biodiversity, as they are formed by the complexity of diverse forest structures, such as broad variations in tree height and diameter (DBH) and conditions of living and dead trees, leading to various ecological niches. However, many efforts of old-growth forest mapping from LiDAR have targeted only one specific forest structure (e.g., stand height, basal area, or stand density) by deriving information through a large number of LiDAR metrics. This study introduces a novel approach for identifying old-growth forests by optimizing a set of selected LiDAR standards and structural metrics. These metrics effectively capture the arrangement of multiple forest structures, such as canopy heterogeneity, multilayer canopy profile, and canopy openness. To determine the important LiDAR standard and structural metrics in identifying old-growth forests, multicollinearity analysis using the variance inflation factor (VIF) approach was applied to identify and remove metrics with high collinearity, followed by the random forest algorithm to rank which LiDAR standard and structural metrics are important in old-growth forest classification. The results demonstrate that the LiDAR structural metrics (i.e., advanced LiDAR metrics related to multiple canopy structures) are more important and effective in distinguishing old- and second-growth forests than LiDAR standard metrics (i.e., height- and density-based LiDAR metrics) using the European definition of a 150-year stand age threshold for old-growth forests. These structural metrics were then used as predictors for the final classification of old-growth forests, yielding an overall accuracy of 78%, with a true skill statistic (TSS) of 0.58 for the test dataset. This study demonstrates that using a few structural LiDAR metrics provides more information than a high number of standard LiDAR metrics, particularly for identifying old-growth forests in mixed temperate forests. The findings can aid forest and national park managers in developing a practical and efficient old-growth forest identification and monitoring method using LiDAR.
