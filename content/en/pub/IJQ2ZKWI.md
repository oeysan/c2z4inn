    <h1>About</h1>
    Benediktsson and Ragnarsdóttir conducted a study to understand how university students experience learning Icelandic as a second language. They interviewed twelve students at the University of Iceland and found that most students were happy with their learning environment and communication with teachers. However, students felt passive in courses focused on grammar and wished for more active participation. They also faced challenges with task-based and group assignments, and some teachers did not fully understand the diverse needs of students, such as the need for extra learning materials. This study highlights the importance of interactive teaching methods and personalized support in language learning to improve student engagement and success.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The aim of this paper is to present and analyze how university students experience teaching methods of Icelandic as a second language and communication with teachers during the learning process. The theoretical framework includes multicultural education theory and second language teaching and learning theories. The findings are based on qualitative interviews with twelve students who study Icelandic as a second language at the University of Iceland. The analysis of the interviews revealed that the participants were generally satisfied with the learning environment and had positive experiences of communication with the majority of the teachers. Nevertheless, the participants described themselves as being rather passive recipients of knowledge in the courses where explicit teaching of grammar was applied, and lacking active participation in the learning process. Additionally, the participants encountered several challenges during the learning process such as issues related to task-based and group assignments and, in some cases, teachers lacked understanding of different students’ needs, such as that of providing extra learning materials.
