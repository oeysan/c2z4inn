    <h1>About</h1>
    Beebe et al. conducted a study involving climate scientists, climate policy experts, astrophysicists, and non-experts to understand why experts disagree and how to respond to such disagreements. They found that climate experts believe there is less disagreement about climate change compared to non-experts. Climate experts also think that disagreements are less influenced by research methods, personal biases, or institutional pressures. In contrast, astrophysicists working on cosmic rays are more open to acknowledging disagreements and accepting multiple interpretations of data. The study also noted that American political context affects experts' views on these issues. These findings help us understand how different fields and contexts influence expert opinions and can guide how we interpret expert disagreements in science.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    We report the results of an exploratory study that examines the judgments of climate scientists, climate policy experts, astrophysicists, and non-experts (N = 3367) about the factors that contribute to the creation and persistence of disagreement within climate science and astrophysics and about how one should respond to expert disagreement. We found that, as compared to non-experts, climate experts believe that within climate science (i) there is less disagreement about climate change, (ii) methodological factors play less of a role in generating disagreements, (iii) fewer personal or institutional biases influence climate research, and (iv) there is more agreement about which methods should be used to examine relevant phenomena we also observed that the uniquely American political context predicted experts’ judgments about some of these factors. We also found that, in regard to disagreements concerning cosmic ray physics, and commensurate with the greater inherent uncertainty and data lacunae in their field, astrophysicists working on cosmic rays were generally more willing to acknowledge expert disagreement, more open to the idea that a set of data can have multiple valid interpretations, and generally less quick to dismiss someone articulating a non-standard view as non-expert, than climate scientists were in regard to climate science.
