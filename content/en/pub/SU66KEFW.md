    <h1>About</h1>
    Strøm conducted an ethnographic study to explore how young people in diverse cultural settings use music to express themselves and achieve their dreams. They focused on a pop duo named GunnInga, examining how their informal musical practices help them strengthen their friendship and pursue their artistic goals. The study used theories about how people structure their actions and the concept of musical agency, which looks at how individuals use music to influence their lives. By analyzing the duo's experiences, Strøm highlighted the importance of music in building connections and fostering creativity in multicultural environments. This research shows that informal music-making can be a powerful tool for personal growth and social bonding.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This article builds upon an ethnographic study of how young people growing up in cross-cultural contexts perform their musical agency (Strøm, 2016). The twofold focus of the article concerns the ways in which the pop duo GunnInga perform their collective musical agency as well as how they strengthen their friendship and fulfill their artist dreams through informal musical practices. The theoretical framework of the article builds upon Stones’s (2005) strong structuration theory. The analysis is structured using Karlsen’s (2011) musical agency lens as a point of departure. In line with Liamputtong’s (2010) request to cross-cultural researchers, the analysis also applies a poem as an analytical tool. The term cross-cultural is applied to situate the pop duo in a context characterized by diversity in terms of bothnationalities and options when it comes to activities, concerts, projects, workshops and so on, offered by both municipal and private cultural agents attempting to respond to this reality.Keywords:musical agency, strong structuration, informal learning,cross-cultural, friendship, artist dreams
