    <h1>About</h1>
    Dmitrow-Devold conducted a study on how teenage girls in Norway present themselves on their blogs over time. By combining interviews and detailed analysis of blog content, they explored how these online self-presentations are connected to the girls' real-life experiences and cultural influences. This research is important because it shows that the way girls express their identities online is not static; it changes as they grow and interact with different contexts. Understanding this dynamic process helps us see how identity is continuously shaped by both online and offline experiences. This insight can be useful for parents, educators, and anyone interested in the impact of social media on youth development.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Blogging has become an integral part of girls’ media culture in Norway. This article investigates how teenage girls in the mainstream blogging community perform selves in their blogs over time. While studies of girls’ self-presentations online abound, most draw solely on analyses of online artefacts and lack a temporal perspective. To address these gaps, this investigation has employed a longitudinal design combining in-depth interviews with ethnographic content analyses of blogs, and has analysed girls’ online-based performances of self as integral to their offline experiences framed by the wider cultural context and gendered discourses. This approach is fruitful because it acknowledges girls’ changing experiences across time and contexts, thus making possible a contribution to the theorization of identity as performed across the online and the offline settings and interactions in an ongoing process.
