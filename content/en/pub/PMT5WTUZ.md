    <h1>About</h1>
    Den Brinker et al. conducted a study on 26 Dutch fathers who work and share household responsibilities with their partners. They explored how these fathers' values influenced their decisions about work and family life. The study found three main types of fathers: those who prioritize work and income, those who seek gender equality in both work and caregiving, and those who struggle to balance work and family due to limited paid work. Fathers who valued work received more support from their partners in household tasks, while those who aimed for gender equality received support in both earning and caregiving. The study highlights the importance of partner support in helping fathers achieve their desired balance between work and family responsibilities.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This qualitative study identified the values of 26 Dutch dual-earnerfathers underlying their actual division of paid and unpaid work,and the role work decisions favoring their family, referred to asFamily Relatedness of Work Decisions (FRWD), and receivedpartner support played in realizing these values. We used thecapability  approach  as  theoretical  framework  to  compareindividuals on the kind of lives they value, and what constrains orenables them herein. Results showed different patterns in what isvalued related to fathers’paid workhours.Work-oriented fathersprimarily  valued  income  provision  and  received  substantialpartner support in caregiving and housework.Work–family fathersvalued gender-equality in the division of labor with support fromtheir partners both in earning and caregiving.Family–workfathers’lack of substantially paid work hampered them inrealizing  their  valued  equal  division  of  labor.  Our  resultsillustrated that fathers’values shaped their time-allocation in paidand unpaid work, in synergy with FRWD and received partnersupport. Moreover, FRWD were more closely related to fathers’values than to their employment type. We conclude that partnersupport needs to be incorporated into the FRWD framework.
