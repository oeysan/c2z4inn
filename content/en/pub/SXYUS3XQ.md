    <h1>About</h1>
    Saul examines how the international law of self-determination can help transitional authorities gain legitimacy. Transitional authorities often struggle to prove they represent the people's will. By committing to self-determination, they can show both domestic and international audiences that they aim to promote governance by the people. However, the meaning of self-determination is debated. Saul discusses how transitional authorities can establish themselves, encourage political dialogue, and create a popular mandate. While international law provides a framework for these authorities to express their vision, it allows them to operate without fully achieving it. This makes specific agreements, like peace deals and UN resolutions, crucial for regulating transitional periods and gaining recognition.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This chapter examines the significance of the international law of self-determination for the legitimacy of a transitional authority. Transitional authorities often have a weak claim to represent the will of the people. A commitment to the international law of self-determination may help a transitional authority to persuade its domestic and international audiences that its purpose is advancement, rather than denial, of governance by and for the people. Yet the content of this law is subject to contestation. The analysis in this chapter covers several features of the self-determination practice of transitional authorities: establishing a transitional authority; developing space for political communication; and creating a popular mandate. The chapter argues that international law offers a transitional authority a means to articulate its normative vision of self-determination, but also to operate lawfully without fully delivering this vision. This reduces the value of a commitment to the law as part of an explanation for why domestic and international audiences should recognise that a transitional authority has the right to rule. It increases the importance of ad hoc instruments for the regulation of transitional periods: peace agreements, aid agreements, and UN Security Council resolutions.
