    <h1>About</h1>
    Angoh et al. conducted a study to determine if the eggs of two turtle species, the Blanding’s turtle and the northern map turtle, can be distinguished based on their external appearance. This is important because the Blanding’s turtle, which is considered threatened, receives more habitat protection than the northern map turtle, which is of special concern. The researchers measured the length, width, and volume of eggs from both species but found that these measurements overlapped too much to reliably identify the species. They suggest alternative methods like incubating eggs to identify hatchlings, using electron microscopy to examine eggshell fragments, or analyzing DNA from the eggshell surface. Accurate identification is crucial for ensuring proper habitat protection for these turtles.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Species at risk in Canada receive different levels of habitat protection depending on their status under the federal Species at Risk Act (e.g., Endangered or Threatened, vs. Special Concern). Accurate detection of species presence can facilitate appropriate habitat protection. For example, the Blanding’s turtle (Emydoidea blandingii; Threatened, COSEWIC 2016) receives legislated habitat protection for its nesting sites on federal lands throughout its Canadian range, and on Crown and private lands in Ontario under the provincial Endangered Species Act. Nesting sites of the sympatric northern map turtle (Graptemys geographica; Special Concern, COSEWIC 2012) do not receive the same legislative protection. The eggs of these 2 species look very similar, making nest identification challenging. In this study we tested whether external egg morphology can reliably identify these species’ eggs, using measurements from 13 Blanding’s turtle clutches (143 eggs) and 72 northern map turtle clutches (873 eggs). Although the mean length, width and volume of eggs differed significantly between the species, strong overlap in the ranges of these measurements prevent reliable identification to species. Alternative methods for egg identification include incubation and identification of the hatchlings, scanning electron microscopy of eggshell fragments, or eDNA analysis of swabs taken from the surface of recently laid eggs.
