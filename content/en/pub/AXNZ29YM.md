    <h1>About</h1>
    Kolberg et al. conducted a study to understand how future climate change might affect farming in Norway, particularly focusing on spring cereals. They used weather data from both historical records and future projections to simulate various farming conditions. The study found that in Southeastern Norway, climate change could improve conditions for spring fieldwork and increase cereal yields. However, in Central Norway, the effects were mixed, with some scenarios showing positive changes and others showing negative impacts. Overall, the variability in workability and yield is expected to increase, with a higher risk of extremely poor years. While profitability and farm mechanization changes were minor, farmers might face challenges with soil water content, potentially leading to lower yields and profitability. These findings are important for planning future farming strategies in cold-temperate regions.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In cold-temperate climate with high soil water content in spring, the farmer often faces the choice between 
topsoil compaction during seedbed preparation and delayed sowing, both of which may reduce attainable cereal 
yield. The objective of this study was to explore whether future climate change with increasing precipitation 
would aggravate this dilemma. We generated weather based on historical and projected future climate in Southeastern 
and Central Norway. Using this weather data as input, we simulated spring workability, attainable yield, 
timeliness costs, and mechanization management with a workability model and a mechanization model. The 
projected climate changes resulted in improved workability for spring fieldwork and higher attainable yield in 
South-eastern Norway, and either positive or negative changes in Central Norway compared to historical conditions. 
We observed a general increase in variability of workability and attainable yield, and a larger risk of 
extremely unfavourable years in the most unfavourable scenarios in Central Norway. Changes in profitability 
and mechanization management were small, but followed the same pattern. The negative effects in the most 
unfavourable climate scenarios in Central Norway were in contrast to positive effects in earlier studies. We 
explained discrepancies by differences in research methods and purpose. However, simulated sowing dates of 
annual crops should consider workability of the soil, in terms of water content. Under worst-case conditions, in 
need of a certain time window to complete their spring fieldwork, farmers might adapt to impaired spring 
workability by working the soil at higher water content than simulated in our study. The consequence would be 
a larger loss of attainable yield and less profitability in the future. We anticipate that negative effects may also be 
expected in other northern cold-temperate regions with high soil water content in spring.
