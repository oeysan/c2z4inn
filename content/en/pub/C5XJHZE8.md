    <h1>About</h1>
    Lange et al. conducted a study to monitor the health of forests in Germany from 2016 to 2022 using a new method called the forest condition anomaly index (FCA). This index uses satellite data to track changes in tree reflectance, which can indicate stress from drought, fires, storms, and insect infestations. By focusing on specific tree species and considering natural seasonal changes, the FCA provides a detailed picture of forest health across different regions. The study found that the FCA could effectively identify areas of forest decline, which is important for managing forest resources and understanding the impacts of climate change. This method offers a more comprehensive way to monitor forests compared to traditional ground-based approaches.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Large areas of Europe have been repeatedly affected by severe droughts. Stressed trees suffered from direct drought impacts such as water stress or heat and were also more susceptible to other biotic and abiotic stress agents and calamities. Monitoring such vulnerable forests area-wide is crucial to assess the highly dynamic climate change induced impacts not captured by traditional ground-based monitoring approaches. However, most remote sensing studies dealing with forest condition are either not species-specific, not accounting for morphological and climatic conditions across different regions, not considering natural variations in phenology or not including multiple disturbance agents. Here, we extract species-specific reflectance time series separately for seven natural regions covering Germany for 2016 to 2022. The seasonal evolution of these time series serves as reference for the detection of forest condition anomalies. We calculated a similarity metric – further called forest condition anomaly index (FCA 
) – between each single reflectance observation and the respective measurements within the reference time series, also considering the natural temporal deviations caused by phenology. Temporal aggregation of the FCA 
 allows the generation of spatially comprehensive forest condition anomaly maps. We demonstrate that the FCA 
 shows patterns related to fires, storms and insect infestations and found an overall agreement with state-of-the-art forest disturbance products using a threshold of  
FCA= -0.15 for forest loss. Consequently, the FCA 
 can be used to detect forest disturbances or linked with vegetation models to assess e.g. forest biomass or carbon flux.
