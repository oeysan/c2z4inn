    <h1>About</h1>
    Cohen et al. conducted a study to improve how health professionals follow infection prevention and control guidelines, which are crucial for reducing healthcare-associated infections. They identified four main types of barriers: personal motivation, social and cultural factors, organizational issues, and work environment/resources. To address these barriers, they developed a practical tool using the positive deviance approach, which focuses on learning from those who successfully overcome challenges. This tool includes specific questions and methods like interviews, focus groups, and simulations to help health professionals find effective solutions. By providing clear steps, this tool aims to make it easier for healthcare workers to implement guidelines, ultimately improving patient safety and care quality.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background 
Although a wide range of intervention programs and methods have been implemented to increase health professionalsâ€™ (HPs) adherence with infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines and decrease the incidence of healthcare associated infections (HAIs), a significant discrepancy remains between the guidelines and their implementation in practice. 
 
Objectives 
This study proposes an applied tool based on the integrated theoretical framework of the positive deviance (PD) approach for developing more effective interventions to mitigate this discrepancy. 
 
Methods 
A qualitative study guided by the PD approach based on data from two sources: (1) in-depth archival analysis of systematic review articles, and (2) integration and synthesis of findings based on an extensive empirical study we conducted, involving 250 HPs (nurses, physicians, support staff and cleaning staff) from three governmental hospitals in Israel, over 35 months (January 2017 to November 2020). 
 
Results 
The barriers faced by HPs were classified into four main categories: (1) individual-motivational, (2) social-cultural, (3) organizational, and (4) work environment and resource-centered. For each barrier, we constructed a set of questions based on the PD approach. For each question, we adapted and applied methodological tools (e.g., in-depth interviews, focus groups, social network maps, video clips and simulations) to help solve the problem. 
 
Conclusion 
Translating a theory-based approach into an applied tool that offers step-by-step actions can help researchers and practitioners adopt and implement the approach within intervention programs to mitigate barriers.
