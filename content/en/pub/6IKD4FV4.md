    <h1>About</h1>
    Wilhelmsen et al. conducted a study to adapt and validate a tool called the Coping with Children’s Negative Emotions Scale (CCNES) for early childhood education and care (ECEC) settings. They surveyed 490 ECEC workers in Oslo and found that the adapted CCNES has three main strategies: emotion dismissing, emotion coaching, and emotion distracting. Emotion coaching and distracting were positively linked to supportive practices and confidence in helping children’s emotional growth, while emotion dismissing was negatively linked. This adapted scale helps assess how ECEC workers handle children's emotions and can improve understanding of teacher-child interactions, aiding in professional development and policy discussions. This study is important for enhancing the quality of early childhood education and care.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Research findings. The Coping with Children’s Negative Emotions Scale (CCNES) is a self-report instrument developed to measure parents’ emotion socialization with their children. This study examined the factorial and convergent validity of a short version of the CCNES adapted for the early childhood education and care (ECEC) context. Using exploratory factor analysis with responses from 490 ECEC-workers from the Oslo Early Education Study, our results revealed a three-factor structure of the CCNES, including emotion dismissing, emotion coaching, and emotion distracting. Model specifications were conducted in half the sample and cross-validated in the other half. ECEC-workers’ coaching and distracting correlated positively with each other and with their reports of supportive scaffolding practices and self-efficacy in supporting children’s socioemotional development. Dismissing correlated negatively with these measures. Practice and Policy. Our results indicate that this ECEC version of the CCNES is a valid instrument to assess ECEC-workers’ emotion socialization strategies in interactions with children, and to support the use of distracting as a separate strategy. This instrument enables extending our knowledge of teacher–child interaction quality in ECEC by examining associations with children’s development. The CCNES could also form the baseline for discussions and reflections about ECEC-workers’ professional roles and development.
