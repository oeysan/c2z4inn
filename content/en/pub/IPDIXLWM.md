    <h1>About</h1>
    Hill et al. explore the complex issue of human-wildlife conflicts, where animals can threaten people's safety and livelihoods, leading to disputes over how to handle these situations. These conflicts can weaken community support for conservation efforts, especially when negative interactions with wildlife occur near homes and fields. The authors highlight that each conflict is unique, making it difficult to apply one-size-fits-all solutions. They emphasize that these conflicts are not just about wildlife but also involve social disagreements among people. While iconic species like elephants often receive more attention, other animals, such as venomous snakes, can pose greater threats. The study underscores the need for effective, sustainable strategies to manage these conflicts, considering both ecological and social factors.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Wildlife can pose a direct threat to the safety, livelihood and well-being of people. Retaliation against  the species blamed often ensues, leading to conflict between groups of people about what should be  done to resolve the situation. Human-wildlife conflicts also negatively affect communities whose support for, and benefit from, wider conservation goals is easily eroded by recurring negative interactions with species close to their lands, fields and homes. Effective and sustainable methods to mitigate and manage these situations are elusive or are often not implemented in a socially or  
economically sustainable way. Each situation is different, with its own history and unique complications, limiting the transferability of methods for reducing the impacts of species as well as people’s behaviour. 
Human-wildlife conflicts involve recurring interactions between people and wildlife yet are always underpinned by social conflicts between groups of people. The species involved may include a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic species – from large cats, bears, elephants, deer, primates, sharks, seals, crocodilians, snakes, rhinos and otters, to invertebrates and plants – and these can be of varying degrees of conservation concern. Typically, human-wildlife conflict cases involving threatened, iconic or well-known species attract the most attention, and in turn the highest volume of voices, opinions, arguments or media coverage. For example, although venomous snakes kill far more people each year in India than do Asian elephants, the latter inevitably tend to gather disproportionately more attention.
