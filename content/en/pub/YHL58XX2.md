    <h1>About</h1>
    Berglund et al. conducted a study to understand how parents' drinking habits, their monitoring of their children, and the children's own behaviors affect the likelihood of teenagers drinking alcohol and getting drunk. They found that if parents drink alcohol, their teenagers are more likely to do the same, especially at age 17. Teens who seek new and exciting experiences are at higher risk of drinking at all ages studied. Interestingly, parents' efforts to control or know their children's activities didn't make a difference. However, when parents actively asked about their teens' lives, it increased the chances of drinking at age 17, while teens who voluntarily shared information with their parents were less likely to drink. This study suggests parents should be mindful of their own drinking and pay attention to teens who crave excitement.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    The aim of this prospective cohort study was to examine how alcohol consumption by mothers and fathers, parental monitoring (knowledge, control and solicitation), adolescent disclosure and novelty seeking were associated with the likelihood of alcohol use and inebriation among adolescents in three different age groups (13–14 years, 14–15 years, and 17 years). The results showed that alcohol consumption by parents is of significance for adolescent alcohol consumption (odds ratio mothers: 1.47 [1.17–1.84], odds ratio fathers 1.33 [1.08–1.65]) and inebriation, especially in the 17-year-old age group. The results showed that novelty seeking was a strong risk factor in all three age groups, while parental control and knowledge had no impact. This study shows that parental solicitation increased the odds at age 17 for alcohol consumption (2.64 [1.02–6.83]) and inebriation, while adolescent disclosure decreased the odds (0.18 [0.05–0.68]). In summary, the study shows that parents should be particularly attentive to adolescents with high novelty-seeking behaviour and that parental alcohol consumption influences adolescent alcohol habits.
