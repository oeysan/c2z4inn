    <h1>About</h1>
    Christensen et al. examine how accounting influences decisions during contested organizational changes, focusing on a case involving the Danish Defence Force. They explore two strategic options that were evaluated differently, using Actor-Network Theory to understand the dynamics. The study introduces the concept of 'trial of strength,' distinguishing between prototype trials and trials of incompatibility. They find that accounting records, or inscriptions, play versatile roles under pressure, helping to shape and assess competing reform options. The research suggests that these inscriptions can sometimes lead to unfaithful behavior, impacting decision-making processes. This study is important because it sheds light on how accounting practices can affect organizational changes and outsourcing decisions, with broader implications for government policies and management strategies.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This paper is about the role of accounting in making decisions about contested organizational change. We study how two strategic options emerged and were valued differently in a protracted case regarding sourcing by the Danish Defence Force. Drawing on Actor-Network Theory we show how the two strategic options emerged and were pitted against each other in what Callon describes as ‘trials of strength’. The contribution of the paper is in three actions: First, it develops the concept of ‘trial of strength’ for accounting and organizational research by showing that extant literature can be enhanced with the conceptualization of a typology of trials that distinguishes between prototype trials and trials of incompatibility. Second, it shows that accounting inscriptions may play changing roles which we label ‘versatile’ when forged in the contested circumstances and resultant pressure of a trial of incompatibility. Third, it highlights how accounting inscriptions take part in (re)formulating, evaluating and advancing mutually exclusive reform options in a series of trials of strength involving both a prototype trial and trials of incompatibility. In addition to the frequency, number and intensity of the inscriptions there appears to be an increased prospect of unfaithful behavior by some inscriptions. This work also has implications for governmentality theorization and processual views of outsourcing decision making - as well as its paradoxical outcomes.
