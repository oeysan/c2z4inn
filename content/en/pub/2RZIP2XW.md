    <h1>About</h1>
    Bjorbærkmo et al. conducted a study examining professional practices in education and health care through a phenomenological lens, which focuses on the lived experiences of individuals. They explored interactions in special needs education, physiotherapy, and weight loss programs by closely observing and interviewing professionals. The study highlights the dynamic nature of these interactions, describing them as a continuous negotiation and exchange between supporting and being supported, confronting and being confronted, and pushing and being pushed. This back-and-forth movement in relational spaces emphasizes the importance of sensitive and caring practices. Understanding these interactions can help improve the quality of professional care and support in both education and health care settings, making them more responsive to the needs of individuals.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    In this article a group of professionals working in education and health care explore 
professional practices and interactions from a phenomenological perspective, drawing on Max 
van Manen’s conceptualization of the phenomenology of practice and his knowledge interest 
in understanding and furthering sensitive, caring professional practice. Posing the question 
what is the meaning of interaction in encounters within education and health care, we look 
at practice experiences drawn from close observations and interviews during research 
concerning special needs education, physiotherapy and weight loss programs. Three anecdotes 
are offered as a way to ‘show,’ rather than interpret, the processes involved. Each anecdote is 
followed by reflections in which we draw on van Manen’s notion of pathic knowledge and 
Nancy’s ideas about co-existence to develop phenomenological insights about temporal, 
embodied and relational qualities of the phenomenon of interaction in professional practice. 
Such interaction seems to involve continuous negotiation. It emerges as a process of exchange, 
a movement back and forth between supporting and letting oneself be supported; between 
confronting and being confronted; between pushing and being pushed. Moments of active engagement give way to periods of waiting for the other to act. The experience is one of 
continuous back and forth movement in the relational space in-between.
