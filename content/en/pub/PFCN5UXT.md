    <h1>About</h1>
    Alehagen et al. conducted a study in Sweden to see if taking selenium and coenzyme Q10 supplements could improve heart health in elderly people with low selenium levels. Over four years, 443 participants took either the supplements or a placebo. The researchers found that those who took the supplements had better heart function, less heart strain, and lower rates of heart-related deaths even 12 years later. They used a method called Structural Equation Modelling to show that the supplements reduced inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn reduced heart tissue damage and improved heart muscle function. This suggests that selenium and coenzyme Q10 could be important for heart health, especially in people with low selenium levels.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Purpose 
Selenium and coenzyme Q10 have synergistic antioxidant functions. In a four-year supplemental trial in elderly Swedes with a low selenium status, we found improved cardiac function, less cardiac wall tension and reduced cardiovascular mortality up to 12 years of follow-up. Here we briefly review the main results, including those from studies on biomarkers related to cardiovascular risk that were subsequently conducted. In an effort, to explain underlying mechanisms, we conducted a structured analysis of the inter-relationship between biomarkers. 
 
Methods 
Selenium yeast (200 µg/day) and coenzyme Q10 (200 mg/ day), or placebo was given to 443 elderly community-living persons, for 48 months. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to investigate the statistical inter-relationships between biomarkers related to inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin-like growth factor 1, expression of microRNA, fibrosis, and endothelial dysfunction and their impact on the clinical effects. The main study was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov at 30th of September 2011, and has the identifier NCT01443780. 
 
Results 
In addition to positive clinical effects, the intervention with selenium and coenzyme Q10 was also associated with favourable effects on biomarkers of cardiovascular risk. Using these results in the SEM model, we showed that the weights of the first-order factors inflammation and oxidative stress were high, together forming a second-order factor inflammation/oxidative stress influencing the factors, fibrosis (β = 0.74; p < 0.001) and myocardium (β = 0.65; p < 0.001). According to the model, the intervention impacted fibrosis and myocardium through these factors, resulting in improved cardiac function and reduced CV mortality. 
 
Conclusion 
Selenium reduced inflammation and oxidative stress. According to the SEM analysis, these effects reduced fibrosis and improved myocardial function pointing to the importance of supplementation in those low on selenium and coenzyme Q10.
