    <h1>About</h1>
    Larsson and Björklund conducted a study to compare leadership behaviors and competencies among different age groups and work environments. They surveyed 7,743 Swedish leadership course participants using a questionnaire. The findings revealed that younger leaders (29 years or younger) rated themselves more negatively compared to mid-aged (30-50 years) and older leaders (51 years or older). Younger leaders in the private sector had more favorable self-ratings. Additionally, young male leaders scored higher on negative leadership behaviors. The study suggests that social competence, developmental leadership, and destructive leadership influence self-rated leadership results. These insights can be useful for leadership development, coaching, and mentoring programs, and they offer new perspectives on leadership theory related to self-confidence, stereotypes, and organizational culture.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Purpose – The purpose of this study is twofold. First, to compare the self-rated leadership behaviors, 
leadership-related competencies and results of the leadership of younger, mid-aged and older leaders; and 
second to compare these aspects among younger leaders in different kinds of the work environment and 
between men and women. 
Design/methodology/approach – Data was collected using the developmental leadership questionnaire 
from a sample of Swedish leadership course participants (N = 7,743). 
Findings – The results showed that the younger group of leaders (29 years old or younger n = 539), rated 
themselves more negatively than the mid-aged (30–50 years, n = 5,208) and older (51 years or older, n = 1,996) 
leaders. Analysis of the group of younger leaders showed that those working in the private sector scored most 
favorably. The gender comparison revealed that young male leaders scored higher on negative conventional 
(transactional) and destructive leadership behaviors. A logistic regression analysis of the younger group 
showed that social competence, developmental leadership and destructive leadership (negative) influenced 
self-rated results of leadership. 
Research limitations/implications – The study is based on leaders’ self-ratings only. 
Practical implications – The results can be used in leadership development contexts and in 
individualized coaching or mentoring programs. 
Originality/value – The results have new implications for leadership theory related to self-confidence, 
stereotypes, selection and organizational culture. 
Keywords Leadership, Work environment, Age, Theory-based measurement, 
Developmental Leadership Questionnaire (DLQ)
