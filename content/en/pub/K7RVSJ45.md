    <h1>About</h1>
    Snipstad explores how school environments impact children labeled as intellectually disabled, focusing on a child named Will. Will spends most of his school time separated from his peers, leading him to create imaginary companions and roles. This study suggests that the way schools categorize and treat children can shape their identities and behaviors. By examining Will's situation, Snipstad raises important questions about whether these imaginary worlds are a response to the segregation he experiences. The findings highlight the need for educational systems to reconsider their practices and policies to ensure they foster inclusive environments that support all children's development and participation. This research is crucial for understanding how institutional structures can influence children's self-perception and social interactions.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    A central aspect of inclusion is to grant all children opportunities to participate and gain from a fellowship in school. However, some categorised groups of children are more prone to segregation and exclusion than others. Drawing on philosopher Ian Hacking’s theories of the interactive relationship between how categories influence the categorised, the structures children are subjected to in schools affect how a child constructs her or his identity. The empirical data of this article are based upon a child (Will) labelled as intellectually disabled who spends most of his time in school segregated from his peers. In this segregated context, he has constructed a universe of imaginary companions and pretended identities (roles) that he frequently interacts with and enters. In relation to the attitudes, approaches and organisational practices that educational institutions subject groups of children to, the discussion questions whether the ascribed roles and function of Will’s imaginary universe is a result of and/or a response to the institutional structures in which he finds himself. If this is the case, the educational system, from policy to practice, has to ask itself what kinds of people do they wish to construct.
