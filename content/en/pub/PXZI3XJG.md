    <h1>About</h1>
    Bergh et al. conducted a study to understand how ready older adults in Norway, who receive home care services, are to use digital health services. They surveyed 149 participants, averaging 78.6 years old, using a questionnaire that measured their technology readiness and well-being. The study found that technology readiness varied significantly among the participants. They were divided into four groups based on their readiness scores. The first group, which was younger and more educated, showed high readiness and could benefit from digital health services. The fourth group had the lowest readiness and would struggle to use these services without significant support. This information is crucial for tailoring health care services to meet the needs of older adults, ensuring that those less familiar with technology receive appropriate care.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    Background With the increasing number of older adults globally, there is a constant search for new ways to organize health care services. Digital health services are promising and may reduce workload and at the same time improve patient well-being. A certain level of eHealth literacy is needed to be able to use digital health services. However, knowledge of technology readiness in this target group of older adults is unclear. Objective The aim of this study was to understand the technology readiness level of a group of older adults who were provided home care services in order to address the present and future needs of this group in relation to the implementation of digital health care services. Methods This quantitative cross-sectional study included 149 older adults from Norway receiving home care services. The participants completed the Readiness and Enablement Index for Health Technology (READHY) instrument, assessments of well-being (World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index [WHO-5]), and assessments of demographic and clinical variables (sex, age, education, living situation, comorbidity, use of digital devices, and use of IT). Cluster analyses were used to group the users according to their technology readiness. Results The mean participant age was 78.6 (SD 8.0) years, and 55.7% (83/149) were women. There was good consistency within the assumed READHY scales (Cronbach α=.61-.91). The participants were grouped into 4 clusters, which differed in terms of READHY scores, demographic variables, and the use of IT in daily life. Participants in cluster 1 (n=40) had the highest scores on the READHY scales, were younger, had a larger proportion of men, had higher education, and had better access to digital devices and IT. Participants in cluster 4 (n=16) scored the lowest on eHealth literacy knowledge. Participants in cluster 1 had relatively high levels of eHealth literacy knowledge and were expected to benefit from digital health services, while participants in cluster 4 had the lowest level of eHealth literacy and would not easily be able to start using digital health services. Conclusions The technology readiness level varied in our cohort of Norwegian participants receiving home care. Not all elderly people have the eHealth literacy to fully benefit from digital health services. Participants in cluster 4 (n=16) had the lowest scores in the eHealth Literacy Questionnaire scales in the READHY instrument and should be offered nondigital services or would need extensive management support. The demographic differences between the 4 clusters may inform stakeholders about which older people need the most training and support to take advantage of digital health care services.
