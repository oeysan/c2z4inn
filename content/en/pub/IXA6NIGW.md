    <h1>About</h1>
    Egan's study explores how the phrases "fail to" and "not fail to" have evolved in the English language. They found that the meanings related to intersubjectivity (how people understand each other) developed later than subjective meanings (how individuals perceive things). Interestingly, these intersubjective meanings did not simply extend from subjective ones but rather from objective senses (facts or reality). For example, in Early Modern English, "not fail to" and in Late Modern English, "fail to" developed unique intersubjective meanings that were unrelated to their subjective counterparts. This research helps us understand how language changes over time and how people use it to communicate more effectively. Additionally, the study considers whether "fail to" might be becoming a way to express negation.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    It is virtually a commonplace in grammaticalization studies that intersubjective senses of lexical or grammatical items develop later than, and as extensions of, subjective senses. The two constructions examined in this chapter, “fail to” and “not fail to”, provide further support for the assertion that intersubjective senses develop later than subjective ones. However, their development challenges the assumption that intersubjective senses always constitute extensions of subjective senses. In fact, both in the case of the “not fail to” construction in Early Modern English (EModE) and the “fail to” construction in Late Modern English (LModE), the intersubjective senses are independent extensions of objective senses, rather than contemporary subjective ones. Moreover, whereas the objective and subjective senses of positive and negative polarity “fail to” code semantic opposites (contraries), their intersubjective senses are completely unrelated to each other. The development of each of these intersubjective senses is first described in detail and then related to the current discourse on intersubjectivity and intersubjectification. Finally, the question of whether positive polarity “fail to” is in the process of grammaticalizing as a marker of negation is addressed.
