    <h1>About</h1>
    Puijk et al. conducted a study on five local newspapers in Norway to understand how they transitioned to online publishing and video use. They found that these newspapers adapted by creating web editions and implementing paywalls, shifting their focus from attracting clicks to gaining subscribers. This change led to more in-depth reporting on specific topics. Although video reporting was costly, streaming local sports helped attract new subscribers. Newspapers that were part of larger conglomerates benefited more from these innovations due to shared resources and expertise in analyzing viewer data. This study highlights the importance of organizational support and strategic changes in business models for local newspapers to thrive in the digital age.

    <h1>Scientific abstract</h1>
    This paper traces convergence and innovation processes in five local newspapers in the Inland Norway region. It is an explorative bottom-up study of how local legacy newspapers’ use of digital technology relates to organisational factors and business models, as well as their journalism. Based on interviews with chief editors and video journalists, the paper shows that these local newspapers adapted in specific ways, sometimes differ from their national counterparts. Each newspaper established a web-edition and later implemented a paywall. This change of business model relates to a change of focus from clicks to subscribers. The change is also reflected in their journalism, focussing on certain topics and more in-depth reporting. While attempts at video reporting turned out to be expensive, streaming local sports became an important element in attracting new subscribers. However, it was easier for those newspapers integrated in larger conglomerates to use these innovations as the parent company provided competence in analysing viewer figures, and because innovations could spread from one local newspaper in the company to the others.
